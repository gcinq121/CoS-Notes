Just notes for the Curse of Strahd campaign
Don't judge lol

All notes are in markdown format but can kinda be viewed with any text editor
Some things like the tables won't work without the specific obsidian plugins I use
- These and all my settings can be found in the .obsidian folder
- My default controls in obsidian use Vi which can be turned off in Setting -> General -> Editor -> Vim Key Bindings at the bottom
- I am not sure if this carries over but just in case

  
I will update whenever I complete the next sessions notes

If there are any changes you want to make I can add editing privilege

I know some of the notes are messy, it should get cleaner as we get more information
