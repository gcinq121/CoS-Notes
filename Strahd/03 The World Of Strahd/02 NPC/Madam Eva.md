The fortune teller for the  [[Vistani]] 
- Before a reading appears to be young and in her 20's
- Throughout the reading it takes something out of her as she becomes older, her skin sagging

Originally met at the [[Tser Pool Camp]] where she told the fortunes of the party
[[Effarig]] believes she has some connection to [[Vistani#Mother Night]] as a deity
[[Revach]] did not like that she said he should be angry for what they took from him
