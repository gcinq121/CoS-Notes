A wereraven boy originally encountered in [[2024-04-27#Mechanical Mantids]]
- [[Revach]] threw a spear at him as a raven before turning back into a human and running off

We found him later at the [[West Gate]] in [[2024-05-05#The Gate to the West]]
- He was badly injured and was going to die if left unattended
- We got him in the wagon and treated his wounds

He woke up later in [[2024-05-05#Back on the Road]] and we interrogated him about who he was 
- We learned he ran away from [[Vallaki]] and his parents own an inn there 
- His parents are [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and Danika Martikov
