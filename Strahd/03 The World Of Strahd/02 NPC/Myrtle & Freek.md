A pair of siblings the party encountered in [[The Windmill]] 

Their parents sold them to some woman in exchange for pies 
- They were kept in cages and fattened up
- Eventually they were killed by the mean ladies and cooked into pies 
- Their bones were milled into flour and are now scattered on the second floor of [[The Windmill]] 

They are from a house just inside the walls of [[Vallaki]] 
- Hopefully their parents are still there 
- Nela and Gorek Ettin
