I am The Ancient, I am The Land. I have dwelt here so long that I have no other origin; my beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. When I was young, when I was a warrior, then I was justice. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a vengeful god, driving my enemies before me and purging them from Toril’s surface. But now… Years of killing have worn down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand.

My youth was devoted to fighting endless wars. While my brother Sergei was weaned on love and peace, I fought battles. While he slept peacefully, I was forced to creep through darkness, framing monarchs for sins that would force their conquering. Still I loved him. Brought him gifts from every land I conquered. I still treasure those moments of calm. I refused to let him get dragged into father’s twisted desires for endless land and war. The desire to be immortalized in history as the man to bring his people the world. Again and again, death, deception, and war, all for my father’s growing empire. Forced to grow apart from my family. Away from Sergei. I wouldn’t let my father drain him as he did me.

I won battles. I won wars. I won land. But respect from my people… I brought trade, riches, and opportunity to my people. But they placed the glory at my father’s feet; condemned me as a barely tame bloodthirsty animal held in check only by his will. As if he cared for them. He simply wanted the glory of an expanding empire. They begged of hunger, so **_I_** fought the Ghaltans and brought them grain. They complained of poor trade, so **_I_** conquered the Kalvians for use of their mines. They complained of hard labor, so **_I_** stormed the Steel City and brought them the secrets of mechromancy. I gave them everything they wanted, and when I looked in the mirror, I realized they stole my youth along with all the rest. Still I would’ve loved them. Still I would’ve cared. **_I WOULD’VE BEEN THE ONLY ONE WHO CARED._** But when I returned home none looked at me with anything but fear. I knew then I had been used. Lied to. Stolen from. Alone. No loving father would put a son through this. No loving mother would look at her son in fear. Never allowed a wife to hold. All I had left was death’s eternal embrace.

I had not been without proposals of marriage in my youth. Was I not a prince in waiting, general of my father’s armies, heir to his throne? But none were good enough for my father. He would never willingly relinquish me from his grasp. One of the supplicants was Patrina Velikovna, a daughter of the dusk elves. Such an arrangement would never be approved of by my father, but she had not come empty-handed: her dowry was the prospect of immortality. Rahadin had driven her from the court on my father’s orders, but father was no longer around to register his objections. I summoned her once again in my valley, the only gift ever given to me, and she taught me the secret of the Amber Temple.

My course was clear. First I had to remove the wardens of the temple, the Order of the Silver Dragon. The last of holding of the Steel City. They claimed honor of single combat and I obliged. But there was no honor that day. It was no man, but Argynvost himself. I stood against him alone, meaning to die with the honor I had left, but Patrina wouldn’t have it. Though she knew I shared not her feelings of love, she sacrificed herself to create a second heart. One to save me from all physical harm should I wish it. For the first time I knew bloodthirst; the white stones shone red in retribution for the friend they had taken from me.

I set out for the Amber Temple in honor of my fallen betrothed. Of the men who started the journey with me, loyal servants all, only three crossed its threshold: Rahadin, who is more like a brother to me than my own flesh and blood, and the wizard Khazan and his apprentice, who had come to steal the secrets that would raise my home to heights never imagined.

We slew many fearsome horrors in those amber halls. Reveled in accursed knowledge. While my wizard and his thrall pored over masonic manuscripts, mere trifles, I found a vault beneath a great library. The walls echoed with voices trapped in amber. They called out to me. One called louder than the rest.

The magic-users left the temple with tomes and scrolls. I left with empty hands and a head filled with a most terrible secret: that I too could cheat death, if I were willing to pay the price.

Returning to the affairs of the living, I determined to surpass my father in the annals of history as I had on the field of battle. I ordered my wizards to build a mighty castle, one that would dwarf my father’s meager mountain holdfast. Riches and wonders he could never claim; I ordered the head of the dragon I slew mounted in my hall; a reminder to all of the power of my vengeance.

As my father had claimed the land in his name, I dedicated the castle to my mother. Upon its completion I summoned her to see what I had wrought, how I had exceeded my father in every way. She brought with her my younger brother, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful, and by mine and my mother’s graces he had been spared the ravages of war. He was also spared the sickness that took her on the road. She never saw the monument that bears her name: Ravenloft.

I did not want for consolers. The great families of the kingdom sent their hapless sons and chinless daughters, all of them seeing in my grief the possibility for their advancement.

One spirit shone brightly above all others. A rare beauty, who was called “perfection,” “joy,” and “treasure.” Her name was Tatyana and I longed for her to be mine.

I loved her for her youth. I loved her for her vitality. I loved her with all my heart. But she spurned me. “Elder” was my name to her, and worse yet, “Brother.” She and Sergei were betrothed. Her heart went to him, and her hand with it. The date was set.

“Brother,” she called me, but when I looked into her eyes they reflected another name – “Death.” It was death that she saw in me. The deaths of all those I had fed to the night mother, and the death that awaited me in turn. She reveled in her youth, but I had squandered mine.

The death she saw in me turned her from me, I know it. And so I came to hate death – my death. My hate was strong. It made me consider again that terrible deal I had rejected… I would not be called “death” so soon.

The voices in amber called out to me from their mountain prison. In truth, they had never left me, or perhaps I never left them; perhaps some part of me dwells there still. They promised me a final triumph over death. But only one offered me that other gift I now sought – the gift of revenge.

The terms were simple: one death born from both love and another returned in hatred. The pact was to be written in the blood that flowed between us.

---

Know that I agonized over my decision until it could be deferred no longer. I did not act until I had to; for what use was life eternal, if eternity would be spent alone?

My warrior’s castle was bedecked in garlands of flowers. It was the day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding. I found Sergei in the chapel, mouthing prayers to his morninglord, his hands wrapped around the hilt of the sword our mother had given him. A sword that had never struck in anger. I commanded him to strike me now. When he refused, I killed him where he stood. My brother, who I hated. Who I loved. My pact was sealed with the first taste of his blood.

My knights took Sergei’s side, of course. They rose up against me, their eyes filled with hatred, and cut me down in my own home. Arrows from the castle guard pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I rose from the stones anew; the arrows piercing my chest, the slashes across my back, the broken bones of my hands, all mended in an instant as I spurned death’s cold embrace forever.

The flagstones ran red with the blood of those who betrayed me, but the greatest betrayal was yet to come.

I found Tatyana weeping in the garden east of the chapel. She fled from me. She would not let me explain, and a great anger swelled within me. She had to understand—the pact I made was for her! All I had done, all I would ever do, was for her! **_I WAS THE ONLY ONE_** **_WHO CARED ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING FOR HER LOVE!_**

She fled from me. I pursued her. Finally, in despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft. I watched everything I ever wanted fall from my grasp forever.

It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found. Not even I know her final fate.

---

I have studied much since then. “Vampyr” is my new name. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. Even the sun is against me now.

But I am the land. The sun is banished from my domain, and little else can harm me now. Even a stake through my heart cannot kill me, though many have tried. But the sword, that damned sword! My fool of a wizard lost its hilt but I will not rest until it is destroyed. Everything Sergei touched must be purged from this land until there is nothing left to remind me of his crimes.

But I cannot forget Tatyana. I have often hunted for her, led by the sight of her auburn hair and the sound of her laughter. I have even felt her within my grasp, but she escapes me! Time and again, she escapes me! When others do not take her from me, she claims her own life, fleeing to that place I cannot go only to return and vex me again. She taunts me! **_She taunts me!_** What will it take to bend her love to me?

I write these words of sorrow as the final part of my pact with the voices in amber. My tale will be added to the annals of woe that line their halls, and I will return to my home far below Ravenloft. I walk among the dead and sleep beneath the very stones of the hollow castle that was to house our family. Those outside call me monster. But I am no more monster than any desperate man. I am a tyrant, a traitor, a kinslayer. I am a warrior, a hero, a brother, a son, betrayed and abandoned by those I loved most. I am beyond titles now, beyond morality, beyond life, beyond even death.

I am the Ancient, I am the Land.
