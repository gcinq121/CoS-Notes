The home of [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] and the headquarters for her "organization" in [[Vallaki]]
When we first entered there was a feeling of it being scrubbed clean of influence
- [[Aeceran]]felt slippery on the floor

In the cellar is a sound proof room with a pentagram on the floor 
- Supposedly for summoning something not great

[[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona Wachter]] has kept the body of her husband in a room on the second floor 
- In that room was also the remaining bones of St. Andral and a book written by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]

Also upstairs is [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s daughter, Stella Wachter 
- She was found in the locked room, insane and rambling about cats and kitties
