A set of gates in central [[03 Barovia|Barovia]], West of Castle Ravenloft
Just South of the windmill

The gate is made of black iron and leads into a short, 20 ft. tunnel
- Appears very similar to the [[East Gate]] 
- The floor in the tunnel is metal but is grown over
- The tunnel ceiling has gems in it making it look like stars

The gate appears to open automatically when something is close to it

This is where the party finds a wereraven boy that [[Revach]] threw a spear at ([[2024-05-05#The Gate to the West]])
