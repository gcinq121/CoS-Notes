## The Final Stretch
After investigating [[2024-05-05#The Abandoned Church]] the party makes their way back to the road 
- On the way, [[Effarig]] notices that after using it in the vacuum, the gem is a bit dimmer

Once they make it back to the road, the party sees [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] looking like they had a workout
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s armor is covered in gore
- Zombie corpses litter the ground
- They were attacked as soon as we were out of sight
- The horse helped during the attack, using the newly repaired shoes to splatter a zombie 100 ft away

After making sure that they are ok, we tell them about what we found and continue on
- We are now only a few hours from [[Vallaki]]
- We agree that we should be cautious, judging by the posters ([[BOMbakery.png]] [[wolfHeadJamboree.png]])
- First priority is getting the wereraven to his parents

Once we are away from the church and zombies we stop for a rest
