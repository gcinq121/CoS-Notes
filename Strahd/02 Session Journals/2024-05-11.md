## The Final Stretch
After investigating [[2024-05-05#The Abandoned Church]] the party makes their way back to the road 
- On the way, [[Effarig]] notices that after using it in the [[Magic Mister]], the [[Light Gem]] is a bit dimmer

Once they make it back to the road, the party sees [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] looking like they had a workout
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s armor is covered in gore
- Zombie corpses litter the ground
- They were attacked as soon as we were out of sight
- The horse helped during the attack, using the newly repaired shoes to splatter a zombie 100 ft away

After making sure that they are ok, we tell them about what we found and continue on
- We are now only a few hours from [[Vallaki]]
- We agree that we should be cautious, judging by the posters ([[BOMbakery.png]] [[wolfHeadJamboree.png]])
- First priority is getting [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] to his parents

Once we are away from the church and zombies we stop for a rest
- [[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] talk for a bit privately
	- After, [[Lionel]] begins work on the cannon
	- He is going to be able to finish it very soon 
- [[Effarig]] goes to speak with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] 
	- He asks if [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will actually destroy the [[Village of Barovia]] 
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says he will at least make an example
	- If he kills everyone he wouldn't have anyone to rule over
- After, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] makes her way over to [[Effarig]] 
	- She swears that she has seen me before
	- When asked in what context, she says when meeting [[Gregori Donavich|Father Gregori]] 
	- This is very odd but may be some sign from [[Church of Kelemvor#Kelemvor]] or [[Church Of Lathander#Lathander]]
- While resting, [[Effarig]] dozes off and then wakes up, noticing that nobody else was around
	- He feels himself being captured by some old women and brought back to [[The Windmill]] 
	- He is put in a cage before being put in an oven and burned alive, hearing the laughing of the women
	- He wakes up from the dream still hearing the laughing 
	- [[Revach]] sees [[Effarig]] doze off and then wake with a start
		- He goes over and I tell him about what happened and how it felt so real

We all mount up to make the final stretch to [[Vallaki]] 
- [[Aeceran]] again mounts up with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and leaves [[Lionel]] red faced and acting awkward
	- [[Aeceran]] asks if it may be safer for [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to outside the city because of all we have heard
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says he wants to take on [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] with us
	- He feels safest with the party 
	- While saying this he seems defeated
- [[Lionel]] continues work on the cannon and asks [[Effarig]] if he wants anything special done with it
- We ask [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] about the town
	- He says the most interesting things are a general store, toymaker, and a market for if you are rich
	- We ask about the toymaker and [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] confirms that it is Blinsky 
		- This is the name on the bottom of the merry-go-round we found in [[The Windmill]] ([[2024-05-05#The Windmill]])
		- He says Blinsky had gotten weirder after getting a monkey 
	- He also talks about an organization called the [[Wachterhaus (Organization)|Wachterhaus]]

Continue on toward [[Vallaki]] and see Lake Zarovich through the trees
- It is glassy but there is one boat far out on the lake

## [[Vallaki]] 
We make it to a large clearing where lots of trees have been felled
There is a long stone wall with a wooden gate
- Most of the buildings are made of wood 
	- Most other places have stone buildings 
- A guard at the top of the gate tells us to stop and announce ourselves
	- [[Aeceran]] nudges [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to have him take the lead
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says he is here with his sister to seek refuge from [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 
	- The guard says that [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] will want to talk with us
	- He orders the gate opened and while we enter he says, "Welcome to [[Vallaki]], where all will be well," almost rolling his eyes

We enter and start heading to the [[Blue Water Inn]], which [[Brae Martikov|Brae]]'s family runs
- There are some larger buildings with yellowed clay buildings 
- Generally everything is small and wooden with second floors jutting out over the street
- There is a feeling of unease in the town
	- Also a feeling of reclusion, you cannot see [[The Windmill]] or even [[Castle Ravenloft]] 
- In the gutters is streamers and pamphlets
	- Even see a banner reading "All will be well"
- There are lots of people here who don't look at you
	- Rushing from place to place 
	- We see many patrols ripping down old posters and putting up new ones
		- Instead of Wolf's Head it is now Blazing Sun
- Firstly passing on our left a stockyard with many warehouses
	- In the center is a platform with people in stocks wearing donkey masks
- See the first house that isn't in disrepair up a road to the north
	- It has a fresh coat of paint with golden lanterns
- Eventually make it to where we smell some good cooking

## [[Blue Water Inn]]
We see a sign above the building that reads, "[[Blue Water Inn]]"
- [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] wakes up smelling the cooking 

Ask [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] if he feels anything off about the town
- Them not caring about strangers is odd
- There are some who peek out of their windows
	- From a quick glance inside [[Effarig]] sees the symbol of an iron tower
	- This is a symbol of either Dispater or Titivilus
	- There are also symbols of [[Church Of Lathander#Lathander]]

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] go around back to take care of the horses
The party goes inside with [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] 
- The inn is packed with mostly commoners
	- Most people are wearing many buckles and have many pouches and bags
- There is a balcony overhanging the main floor 
- The whole area is lit with an orange light that isn't usual
- Many wolves heads are mounted on the wall
- The people here are drinking heavily for how early in the day it is
- A man in fancy, colorful garb stands on a table in the middle of the inn 
	- He orates to the whole inn a story we came in the middle of
- A pair of men dressed in fine clothes, leather armor, and have fine swords on their sides
	- They appear to be hunters
	- Another pair looking similar sits close, wearing cheaper, more tattered clothes and one has an eye patch

While we are looking around, the woman behind the bar looks over to welcome us before seeing [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] and dropping the glass she was cleaning
- She rushes over to him and asks us what happened 
- We tell her he was injured by a javelin 
	- When asking for more info we tell her we probably should go somewhere private 
	- She leads us back to the kitchen
- A large man is at the fire cooking before turning to see [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] and rushing to hug him 
- [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] is then taken up to his room by his brother Brom 
- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] says that he heard that there were new people in town
	- [[Aeceran]] presses him as to how he could know since we just entered
	- After some pressing [[Aeceran]] tells [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] that we know they are wereravens
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] asks our allegiances and makes us swear not to tell anyone
- They ask why we are there 
	- We are escorting [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] from the [[Village of Barovia]] 
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] has heard that something happened but does not know why [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is after [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
- We ask what is going on in the town
	- The town is fairly safe and the flyer was for a festival they had last week
		- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] is optimistic that with enough happiness the town will slip from the grasp of [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 
		- They have had festivals weekly for six years now
		- People have grown weary of them and started to leave children home but [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] made their attendance mandatory
	- We ask about the B.O.M. Bakery and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] says it is near the town square
		- It is best to not ask questions about it though 
	- We ask if [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] has caused any problems for the town
		- There are wolves and other dangers in the woods
		- No minions of [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] have made it past the walls in years 
		- This could be because of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]'s idea working or maybe the Bones of St. Andruil beneath the local cathedral
	- One final warning is to stay away from the [[Wachterhaus (Location)|Wachterhaus]] 
		- They are still loyal to [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 
		- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] will likely reach out to us for a chat
			- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] will try to schedule a meeting at the same time
		- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has just as many guards as [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] 

Finally things feel like they are settling down and the man and woman introduce themselves
- The man is [[Urwin Martikov]] and his wife [[Danika Dorakova]] 
- Because we brought back [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] we have two free rooms for a few nights
- [[Aeceran]] offers to play his viol to help pay 
	- The orator in the inn now is Rictavio
- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] may have a task for us depending on where we go next
	- Seek out [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] at [[St. Andral's Church]] down the road 
	- [[Effarig]] asks about faith in the town
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] says some have a cultish persuasion believe the morning lord has abandoned them and should worship [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 

The parents ask about how [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] got injured 
- We explain that he got caught in a battle we were having
- [[Revach]] saw him as a raven and hit him with a spear
- We then found him at the [[West Gate]] and took him with us to [[The Windmill]] 
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] asks if we saw the children in [[The Windmill]] and we say yes 
	- [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] was supposed to lead us North away from [[The Windmill]] which [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] calls The Bonegrinder
		- [[Effarig]] asks if he knows the Erwins, [[Myrtle & Freek]]'s parents 
		- He says they live in a small house near the stockyard
		- [[Effarig]] says he needs to talk with them about his god 

We are forgiven for injuring [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] and we leave the kitchen 
- [[Revach]] shakes [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s hand, apologizing for striking his son
