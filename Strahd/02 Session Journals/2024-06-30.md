## Let's Start a Riot
We leaf through the Tome of Strahd and using the books we have collected we are able to translate it
- It tells the story of his becoming the ruler of this land 
- His brother was betrothed to a woman named Tatyana who he was smitten with
- After killing his brother, Tatyana doesn't reciprocate feelings and flings herself from [[Castle Ravenloft]]
- He whines about everyone who he loved leaving him when it is entirely his fault
%% That was last session but we got that info between %%

Stella Wachter is standing outsider her room, holding the skeletal cat 
- [[Aeceran]] says we should do what we can to get her to Victor Vallakovich

[[Aeceran]] begins gathering things up thinking about our next moves
- He grabs the portrait of the wedding and pulls the chest out of the wardrobe
- [[Effarig]] asks Stella if she knows where Victor is
	- She says he is in a prison in his room and rambles about kitties not being cats

Looking into Stella's room it is very sad 
- There is nothing in there and it is bare
- Some trays are in the corner with scraps of food on them 
- The boards are warped from where she was pacing, divots in the floor
	- Looking at her feet, [[Lionel]] sees they are in bad shape and bandages them up

Before doing anything we consider our next steps
- We want to show everyone what was happening
- Get both [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] out of here 
- If we just go into the streets, showing people everything, we can start an uprising
- We decide to fully commit and parade the atrocities of [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] around town and to the square
	- We take a cultist, the painting of the wedding, the chest of St. Andral's Bones, a quasit, Stella, and the book to translate abyssal
	- [[Aeceran]] takes and conceals the Book of Strahd not wanting to show anyone

We move into the street parading what we saw and crying out to get attention
- "Your town is not as safe as you think"
- "See the offenses of [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and the results of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s ineffective rule"
- "She stole the bones of St. Andral"
- People at first just look out their windows concerned before they start coming out and following
	- They are trying to get a look at what we are carrying
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] come out of the [[Blue Water Inn]] to meet us
		- [[Aeceran]] tells them to follow since it will be safest
- The crowd grows and we make it to the town square, people pushing to get a look at what we have

Once in the square we hear a booming voice coming from behind us
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] arrives with his two mastiffs, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] and many guards
- We yell to the crowd how he allowed this to happen
	- He sent us to take care of this so he was trying something
- The crowd grows more vibrant as [[Aeceran]] argues with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]

The tension builds as [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] begins to back up, his guards surrounding him
- It breaks as the mob rushes forward to get at him
- They swarm, running over everything in their way, knocking down everyone but [[Aeceran]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is almost knocked down before [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] clears away any who touched her 

We all stand, bruised but not injured
- The people attack the town guards and we hear as [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] yells out trying to quell the mob before he is silenced
- [[Effarig]] scoops up Stella as we assess where we should go next
- From behind the crowd we see a line of fire heading away as [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] dashes to the manor

## Saving Victor
[[Lionel]] and [[Effarig]] go to get everyone safe in [[St. Andral's Church]] 
- They take Stella and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] as well as [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and the bones 

---

[[Revach]] and [[Aeceran]] begin toward the manor hoping to free Victor
- They make it as [[Aeceran]] climbs the front up to where he saw the cat in the attic window 
- Inside are many cats and a faint blue light 
- Like all the other windows in [[Vallaki]], this one is covered in metal bars 
	- Reaching through them, [[Aeceran]] punches at the window trying to break it
- Back at the bottom, servants rush out the door to see [[Revach]]
	- He tells them a mob has started and they should leave as soon as they can 
	- One asks if they have time to get food before [[Revach]] looks back at the approaching mob

---

[[Lionel]] and [[Effarig]] are half way to [[St. Andral's Church]] when they see [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] with Milivoj and Yeska running to the square 
- They tell them that a mob has started and we have the missing bones 
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] sends [[Effarig]] with bandages to help those who are injured as he picks up a side of the chest
- He orders Milivoj and Yeska to get the church ready to look after the injured 
- While we stand there, Stella seems to smell something before taking off toward [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s manor 
	- [[Lionel]] tries to grab her as she says she needs to get the cats and slips from his grasp 

---

[[Aeceran]] breaks through the window and tells the cats to get back and they do
- With a loud strike of thunder he doesn't displace the bars but puts a hole in the wall next to them 
- Inside are 6 cats and an arcane circle on the floor 
	- He can't tell what it is for but knows it is incomplete

---

[[Effarig]] returns to the square and looks for anyone hurt
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] lies dead and his wife is on death's door
- Many guards and civilians are dead or dying
	- He sees [[Thimdul|The Blacksmith]], unconscious and likely to bleed out 
- As [[Effarig]] helps those who need it he sees some of the mob heading East, burning indiscriminately 
- The Martikovs, Apothecary, and Blinsky are not to be seen

---

At the manor, the mob makes it to [[Revach]] asking what side he on 
- After saying he doesn't take sides the mob begins to go after him as he runs around the back 

In the attic, [[Aeceran]] asks the cats for any help and they bring him some scattered papers
- They then go sit in the sections of the circle taking up 6 of the 8
- From the notes, [[Aeceran]] makes out that it is a combination of conjuration and transmutation magic 
- He sees dolls scattered in one corner 
	- A young man, Stella, and Lady Petrova, [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s wife
	- They are in the style of Blinsky's doll of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]

[[Lionel]] makes it to the back of the manor, running after Stella as [[Revach]] rounds the corner 
- Stella stops, trying to open the door giving a chance for [[Revach]] to grab her 
	- She is restrained but keeps fighting and rambling
- [[Lionel]] tells him to take her back to [[St. Andral's Church]] as he goes to help [[Aeceran]]

[[Lionel]] shoots his gun in the air to distract the mob from [[Revach]]
- [[Aeceran]] goes back to the roof going to tell [[Revach]] he might need Stella and the cat 
- [[Aeceran]] runs down the side of the mansion and scoops up Stella, bringing her up to the attic 
- [[Lionel]] runs in the back door, trying to get to the attic 

---

[[Effarig]] is still in the square, helping people and getting their last wishes
- The man and woman who were always in the church ask him to find their son 
- He is able so save most from the brink of death and continues patching people up

---

[[Lionel]] starts rushing around the manor looking for the stairs
- He passes a room where he hears someone rummaging around and chains rattling from down the hall
- Looking in the room he sees [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]
	- He is packing up his things, all the dolls of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] strewn about 
	- [[Lionel]] straight up asks what is up with the dolls 
		- He says he needs to protect her, he has seen her in his dreams
- Asking where Victor is, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] grabs his things and begins leading [[Lionel]] through the house
	- In a bedroom, he uses his fiend arm to fire blast a hole in a hatch leading to the attic 
	- The room has almost nothing in it and is covered in cobwebs
	- Across the room is a door with "All is not well" written on it in red 

From inside the room with the cats, [[Aeceran]] hears the door rattle and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s voice followed by [[Lionel]]'s
- He unbars the door and lets them in
- Stella and the boney cat sit in the last two spots on the circle but nothing happens
- [[Aeceran]] shows [[Lionel]] the notes and he starts looking for something to fix the circle 

---

[[Revach]] is running away from the mob back toward the church 
- On his way he sees Milivoj and Yeska running to the square with bandages 
- He runs up and asks where [[Effarig]] is and they say the town square 
- Running there with the boys they see [[Effarig]] tending to people 
- There is a glass breaking noise coming from the East and they decide to go take a look 

In the stockyard, the colorful wagon is toppled over and open
- There is no longer anyone in the stocks
- Going further there is a pack outside [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] as well as the barracks
	- The section at [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] seems to want to go inside but they can't move forward 
	- Getting closer, there is a sabretooth tiger between them and the door, bearing its teeth and nipping at people 
	- [[Effarig]] calls out to try and calm the mob before they turn on him for defending the outsider
	- [[Effarig]] tries to get them to calm down, firing his cannon, but they are not scared off 
	- Him and [[Revach]] are able to take care of a lot of the rioters and have the others run away
- The tiger now looks between the two of them trying to assess if they are a threat 
	- They say they aren't and it seems to relax a bit 

Richtavio comes around a corner holding a steak on a stick and calling for "Ramses"
- He sees us there and comes over, feeding the tiger 
- [[Effarig]] asks why he is so casual and he says he is not scared of commoners and was going to leave soon anyway
- He says he is surprised Ramses protected the apothecary before seeing she is party elf and saying that makes sense 
- He asks what side we are on in all this 
	- [[Effarig]] says we are on [[Vallaki]]'s side with a nat 20 persuasion
- He says he has a home West down the river and it is hard to miss, inviting us there 

Richtavio walks off and the two left there in the street decide to check in on the apothecary

---

[[Lionel]] studies the notes for a moment and sees what someone was trying to do
- It is a blend of the magic of a teleportation circle and polymorph
	- When you step in it is supposed to polymorph and take you away 
	- Instead it split whoever stepped into it apart 
- Looking at the circle, [[Lionel]] is able to easily repair the broken parts with another nat 20
	- As soon as he finishes, the cats all start to spin around and phase into one another 
	- Once this finishes, Victor Vallakovich and Stella Wachter stand in the circle, dirty but Stella is not as gaunt
	- "Holy fuck I am not a cat"

##  Calming a Mob
[[Aeceran]] quickly explains that there is a mob and they took Victor's father 
- [[Aeceran]] begins to ferry people out to the roof to get them away 
- Victor scrambles to pull up a floorboard and pulls out a book 
	- He asks [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] for his help as muscle if this doesn't go well and he agrees
	- Asking what is going on, he wants to quell the mob
- Victor taps [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] on the shoulder and they both teleport to outside the front of the manor 
	- He yells to get their attention and launches into a speach
	- [[Aeceran]] on the roof provides emphasis to his words
	- Both [[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] notice there is magic on his voice 

After some time the main leaders of the group seem persuaded
- At first a few then many begin dropping torches and pitchforks

------

[[Effarig]] and [[Revach]] go over to [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] and knock
- Anya is initially startled but comes out and wants to go to the Vistani camp or [[St. Andral's Church]]
- She quickly gathers the rest of her things into chests, the walls of the store now bare

Going back through the streets it is quiet with most of the people to the East 
- There are ravens on top of the [[Blue Water Inn]] some flying in and out 
- We see to the North a man and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] standing outside the mansion but decide to continue 

---

Victor continues to calm the mob
- He says there will be a meeting tomorrow at noon to discuss the future of the town
- He asks [[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] to help with the rebuilding and tells Stella to go to [[St. Andral's Church]]


## The Future of [[Vallaki]]
[[Revach]] and [[Effarig]] safely make it back [[St. Andral's Church]]
After some time, Victor and [[Aeceran]] are able to disperse what is left of the mob
- It seems to have burned itself out 
- [[Aeceran]] reminds Victor that [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] needs to pay for her crimes
- [[Aeceran]] lets him know that [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and one of her sons are unconsicous in the [[Wachterhaus (Location)|Wachterhaus]]
	- He also tells him about Nikolai Sr.
	- Victor wants to get [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] and her son somewhere safe before someone "saves" them 
	- Use bedsheets to cover them as they are brought to [[St. Andral's Church]]
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] has been shadowing Victor and [[Aeceran]] asks if he can trust he won't rip his head off 
	- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] says as long as Victor doesn't say to do so

Victor makes his way to [[St. Andral's Church]] while [[Aeceran]], [[Lionel]], and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] get the bodies from the [[Wachterhaus (Location)|Wachterhaus]]
- [[Aeceran]] asks [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] what his deal is to which he says he survives
- Asked about his obsession with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] he says he has seen her in his dreams 
	- He thinks they were siblings once
	- He had a sister who disappeared into the woods maybe two decades ago
	- He is originally from a village near the river, Berez
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] worked for the baron to survive 

Looking at Nikolai Sr., [[Lionel]] sees he has some boils on him
- It was likely a sickness that took him

[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] says Victor has been gone for months
- He botched the magic thing 
- He learned it from a book that washed up from the lake

[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] was 5.5 when his sister disappeared

[[Lionel]] takes the opportunity to look through the books in the library
- He finds some fairy tales where red and gold gems are used as a MacGuffin

Carrying the bodies back to [[St. Andral's Church]], [[Aeceran]], [[Lionel]], and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] get some strange looks 

---

Back at the church, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] come up from the crypt saying [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] wants to talk with [[Effarig]] and [[Revach]]
- Going down [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks where we found the bones 
- He is surprised it couldn't be felt that they were there 
- [[Effarig]] says there was a counteracting force, the Book of Strahd that kept it neutral
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] asks where the book is now and says to never leave it our of our sight 

---

The other memebers make it to 100ft from the church and [[Aeceran]] gets a splitting headache
- The range of consecration has spread out further now that the bones are there
- [[Aeceran]] marks in the road where the field starts and continues 
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] says he can feel the consecration too, like he is being stabbed through the temples

---

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] says he doesn't know what will happen next
- He hopes Stella and Victor can put the town back together
- He asks [[Revach]] and [[Effarig]] to protect the town if they can't
	- [[Effarig]] says we will not leave before things are put back together 
- They head back up, into the church seeing [[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] walking in reuniting the party 
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] and her son are brought up to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s office

## Scale Nails
In [[St. Andral's Church]], recuperating, [[Lionel]] feels a pull in his pocket from the dragon scale
- It seems to be repulsed from [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] like a magnet
- Going over to [[Aeceran]] it is similarly repulsed but less so

We all go to talk with Victor about the next steps for the town
- Victor wants to make sure we keep people from ripping their heads off 
- He says that [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] still deserves a trial for her crimes 
	- He doesn't want to rebuild on hate and death 
	- We are asked to help oversee this process
	- If we show support we can get more people on board 

Victor seems happy to see [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] again

[[Aeceran]] asks what is up with the dolls
- Big [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] goes white
- Victor said the ones he had were for a spell
	- He wanted to put parts of his soul into the dolls and the better the likeness the easier it would be
	- He wanted to move around the valley as a cat, quickly going where he needs to go
- As for the ones of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], he was trying to help [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]
	- [[Aeceran]] asks if he was trying to scy her and he doesn't know that name 
	- It was something in the book he found that talked about seeing people from afar
	- He found the book by an outlet of the lake
		- Supposedly people saw the old wizard from the revolution
		- It is filled with notes on realms beyond his comprehension
		- It is half history and half spells with some notes on the Steel City
- The group breaks up as Victor leaves to be with Stella 

[[Aeceran]] lets [[Effarig]] know that the consecrated aura around the church is growing

[[Lionel]] tells everyone about the scale and we go outside the aura to test it
- Lionel explains that the scale was fidgeting, trying to get away from [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] and [[Aeceran]]
- Getting to [[Aeceran]]'s mark in the road, he doesn't feel any better 
	- We continue a bit and it does clear up
	- The aura is slowly expanding around [[St. Andral's Church]]
- We go into an alley to test out the scale 
	- [[Lionel]] goes to pull it out of his pocket with no gloves on
	- Once he touches it he feels something poking at his mind
	- It flips through his memories, slowly at first then quickly before the presence retreats
	- As his life flashes in reverse, [[Lionel]] comes back to the alley and notices black tendrils growing out of his skin before the disintegrate when he moves 
	- All presence from the scale is gone
- We all see as [[Lionel]] holds on to the scale a bit longer than we expected
	- [[Aeceran]] asks what is up and [[Lionel]] says he remembers something 
	- [[Aeceran]] says maybe he wont try it, having things he doesn't want to remember 
- The scale is still repulsed from [[Aeceran]]
	- Taking it, he feels that whatever is in it is probing
	- Giving it the memory of waking up after he died, the presence recedes away with a feeling of disgust
- The presence wasn't divine and as it left there was a feeling of incompatibility 
- [[Revach]] decides to give it a shot and takes the scale 
	- It also feels the presence flipping though his memories one by one 
	- It lingers on the one where he lost her 
		- The presence takes this memory apart, feeling every emotion
	- It shows him a memory it has 
		- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is walking battlements and men in armor are shield to shield, butchered
		- [[Revach]] feels loss and anger at not being able to save them 
	- The scale dissolves in his hand moving and covering his finger nails 

[[Revach]] scratches at the new nails but it just feels like he is scratching at his own
- [[Lionel]] asks if he likes it and he says we will see 
- [[Revach]] has a feeling of being known from the scale 

[[Effarig]] and [[Lionel]] go to get injured people and bodies from the town square 
[[Revach]] and [[Aeceran]] go back to [[St. Andral's Church]], [[Revach]] looking at his hand as they go

Going in the church, [[Revach]] and [[Aeceran]] see [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] staring at each other, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to the side 
- [[Aeceran]] goes over to see what is going on and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says they have been like this for 10 minutes
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] finally says that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] was adopted, found at the edge of the woods 
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] says they have just been thinking and it is a lot to take in
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] isn't convinced and says there could be nothing there 
- [[Aeceran]] begins to ask about each other's memories and the timeline of things 
	- Both of them were very young and don't remember much
	- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] only remembers walking down a path with his sister, turning around, and she was gone
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] remembers playing in the water with [[Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks [[Aeceran]] what the next move should be
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] want to move out soon but we promised we would stay at least a little while 
- We also want to speak with the [[Vistani]] outside town
- He says he and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] will stay in the church for now but won't want to for long
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] voices that he doesn't trust [[Aeceran]] as much anymore
	- He hid what he was and even his name 
- [[Aeceran]] says "It's good to know you are like everyone else" and walks off 

[[Revach]] just sits covering his hand with his sleeve

[[Lionel]] works on his raven and tried to recreate the cologne he smelled in Blinsky's Toys
- Also the [[Magic Mister]]

After a few hours some noise is coming from [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s office 
- We put a gag on [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] to make sure she doesn't cast anything 

To get another sniff at the cologne, [[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] head to Blinsky's Toys
- Piccolo checks out the window before Blinsky opens the door
- They tell him the mob is gone and that [[Lionel]] smelled the cologne the last time we were there 
- Smelling again, [[Lionel]] can tell it is very old and mixed with many things
- Blinsky for sure doesn't smell like that cologne and thinking back Richtavio doesn't either
