## Vampiric Saint
[[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] begin, going to check on the Martikovs
- The number of ravens on the [[Blue Water Inn]] has diminished
- [[Aeceran]] gets the attention of one who swoops down
	- [[Lionel]] tells it what is ahead, the trial of [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] tomorrow and [[Stella Wachter|Stella]] and [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] are running things
	- It flutters back up to the chimney and goes in
- Waiting for some time, nothing more happens and they head back to [[St. Andral's Church]]

[[Effarig]] and [[Revach]] are at [[St. Andral's Church]], helping those who need it
- Most people are being tended to and rounds are being made 
- Seeing that [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] is free, [[Effarig]] goes to ask about the dead couple's last wishes
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says they were a nice couple, true followers of Lethander
	- There are legends that if you pray for 10 days and nights with no food or drink, Lethander will lessen what ails you
	- Their son went missing a while back which is unfortunately not uncommon
		- Nobody believed that they didn't know what happened
		- He went into the street to play and didn't come home
		- Many believe it is the fault of B.O.M Bakery
		- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] wishes he could believe the couple 
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] asks what our plans are
		- We will stay to help put thing back together
		- Feel responsible for the state of the town
		- [[Effarig]] tells him that the consecrated area is still growing
		- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] then heads to the crypt to inspect the [[Bones of St. Andral]]

[[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] make it back to the church 
- They both head down to the crypt, where [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] is
- [[Aeceran]] sees the crypt for the first time hearing muttering down the way
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] is picking up each bone, gingerly, and inspecting them 
- Startling him, [[Aeceran]] asks him some questions about the [[Bones of St. Andral]]
	- Asks what he knows about the history of the [[Bones of St. Andral]]
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] doesn't know much but is inspecting them hoping to find more information
	- He doesn't know why the bones are vampiric 
	- He shows them teeth marks on one of the [[Bones of St. Andral]] and [[Lionel]] agrees they could be
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] asks about [[The Tome of Strahd]]
	- [[Lionel]] tells him it is a bibliographic history of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] understands how it countered the holiness of the [[Bones of St. Andral]]
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] asks where it is kept and [[Aeceran]] says he has it
		- He says to be weary of thoughts that aren't his own
		- It can corrupt and he is concerned about it being held by someone connected to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- [[Lionel]] tells [[Aeceran]] to let us know if he wants to kill us
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says he will let them know if he finds anything
	- [[Aeceran]] asks if he knows why the [[Bones of St. Andral]] would be holy
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] doesn't know of any [[Vampires|Vampire]] besides [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- [[Aeceran]] tells [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] that is name is in fact [[Aeceran]]
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] could use [[Lionel]]'s assistance examining the [[Bones of St. Andral]]

[[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] come back up from the crypt
- [[Effarig]] goes over to [[Lionel]] to check in on what is happening
- They both decide to go down to help [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]
- Looking at the bones again, [[Lionel]] sees the teeth marks of at least 60 people
	- There are areas where the bone is thinner than it is in other places
	- Some of it looks weak, quickly grown 
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says there are a lot of stories that are not true or mask the truth
	- Makes them more digestable for the masses
	- Maybe St. Andral sanctified because he was sacrificed on an alter of Lethander
	- Sacrifices are uncommon for most gods and very rare for Lethander
		- The power of most sacrifices fades fast so this magic to linger it must have been large
- [[Lionel]] tells [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about vampire's ability to regenerate
- [[Effarig]] asks if there is anything else in [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] as old as [[St. Andral's Church]]
	- There is a castle to the South-West housing a conclave of knights led by a scaled beast
	- The abbey near Krezk was built after the fall of [[Vallaki]]
		- One of the boys mentioned a new abbot
	- Of course, there is [[Castle Ravenloft]]
		- Only one person, [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has ever been invited
		- She was invited when she was young and told of machines and a creature who told really bad jokes

When [[Aeceran]] came up from the crypt, he did not see [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
- He finds [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] on the second floor who says [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] went on a walk with Milivoj
	- He wanted to check on the Martikovs
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] suggests that [[Aeceran]] shouldn't be the one to go after him
	- She will go with [[Revach]] to the [[Blue Water Inn]]

Inside the [[Blue Water Inn]], [[Revach]] smells wine
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is stumbling around carrying a barrel
	- He yells to Milivoj on the second floor to keep looking for something
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] invited [[Revach]] to drink with him
- [[Revach]] says he should come back to the church while [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] checks on Milivoj
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is complaining how nobody listens to him
	- Always the lesser he will be
	- Asks [[Revach]] what he thinks he is missing
	- Asks [[Revach]] about keeping his composure after seeing him hit himself
	- Goes on about how [[Revach]] can trust [[Aeceran]] not to bite himself
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and Milivoj come down saying they couldn't get into the attic space
	- Twas locked
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is convinced to go back and they begin toward [[St. Andral's Church]]

[[Revach]] gets back with the crew, practically carrying [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]
- [[Lionel]] checks in the [[Revach]] and tells him to take care of himself

Everyone settles in for a long rest
- [[Lionel]] and [[Effarig]] are woken up by rain and wind through the streets
- As dawn approaches, a crack of thunder rattles the church

## The End of this Cycle?
[[Aeceran]] wakes up drained without feeling rested
It is raining hard and there is lots of lightning
- It seems to be repeatedly striking to the South-West near the Vistani Camp 

[[Aeceran]] looks hungover and we hear heaving from [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] upstairs
[[Effarig]] asks around the church for the Entins
- They haven't been here and haven't been seen since yesterday
- He gets specific directions to their home, first left from the gate, third house on the left

The party steps out of the house and head to the Entin's
- The curtains are drawn and we can get only a slight glimpse inside 
- [[Effarig]] goes and knocks at the door that goes unanswered
- [[Lionel]] cases the place, going around it
	- He doesn't smell much coming from inside
	- He sees many beds in a smaller room and also gets a look into the master bedroom
- [[Effarig]] bangs on the door again, more insistent
	- An older woman comes to the door and asks what we want 
- [[Effarig]] asks if [[Myrtle & Freek]] come to mind 
	- The woman pulls the door open, angry
- [[Effarig]] keeps badgering her about the children, following her in as she backs up
	- She calls for her husband, Gorek
- After more stiff-arming, the woman begins to sob in their living room as Gorek begins to explain
	- He says they were tricked 
	- The pies they got make nothing matter and when you wake up it all collapses
	- The bakers said they would help get the children back if they gave them another
	- They gave up their unborn in exchange
	- The Abbot from the abbey had notes that would help them bring their children home
- The man sighs and opens up a secret passage to their basement and everyone follows down the stairs

Chained to the walls is a partially complete stone golem
- If they followed the instructions in the book it would hold their souls
- [[Aeceran]] asks who the abbot is and they only know he works in Krezk
- [[Lionel]] has a look at the golem
	- Gorek says it is chained up in case it moves on its own
	- [[Lionel]] wants to see the notes and Gorek says he can't remember them 
	- He was shown the book once and it was burned into his memory
	- When he tries to write them down it turns out as scribbles
- Gorek asks if we can help complete the golem 
	- [[Effarig]] asserts that would be unnaturally prolonging their lives
	- [[Aeceran]] believes the children should decide 
	- [[Effarig]] says they don't deserve them, traded them for pies, Gorek says we don't understand 
- This would only be the first golem, holding one of the children 
	- It would take years to make another 
	- [[Lionel]] guesses he could finish it in a month of straight work 
- 10 years ago they swore off the pies 
	- Went to [[The Windmill]] and the children weren't there after yelling and screaming for them 
- [[Effarig]] leaves and Gorek says we can't stop them from trying 
- [[Lionel]] wants to see the golem complete, regardless of if [[Myrtle & Freek]] are put within it
	- He takes another look at the golem and sees it is pretty shoddy work, using iron to shape iron 
	- [[Lionel]] leaves a note, correcting some perceived mistakes in the creation
- The party leaves as [[Effarig]] leads to the B.O.M bakery

On the door is a wooden sign, "Closed Due To Mob"
- Through the door we see a flier saying they are moving to the [[Village of Barovia]]
- [[Lionel]] smells at the door noticing it smells like [[The Windmill]]
	- Less burnt, smell of a room filled with precious metal
- [[Lionel]] tried to pick the lock before feeling a pop as it spits out acid
- [[Effarig]] kicks down the door, hinges snapping
	- An old woman is behind the counter and yells "We have customers" as another woman comes down the stairs
	- [[Effarig]] goes to shoot them before she says to wait 
	- The first woman turns into an 8 foot tall blue hag 
- [[Revach]] asks what B.O.M. stands for before they introduce themselves
	- The last woman comes down and they say their names, spelling our B.O.M.
- The large hag notices we aren't in a talking mood before trying to turn [[Effarig]] into a chicken
	- [[Lionel]] transforms and shoots his blunderbuss 
	- The fight goes on but we were damaged by the lock 
	- [[Effarig]] and [[Aeceran]] go down and [[Lionel]] tries to pull [[Effarig]] away from the fight
- The hags try to make a deal with [[Lionel]] and [[Revach]]
	- Tell everyone they meet to try B.O.M. bakery in the [[Village of Barovia]] and leave them alone
	- [[Revach]] refuses and is turned into a millipede
	- [[Lionel]] similarly refuses, snarling at the hag 

In this precarious position, we end, assuming the end of these adventurers
