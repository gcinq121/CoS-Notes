## The Gate to the West
It is early afternoon after we defeat the mantis automata, about 2:00
- [[Aeceran]] guesses we can reach where the road turns East before we need to rest
- I continue helping the horse pull along the wagon
- [[Lionel]] continues work on the mechanism for the horses hooves

As we rest, recovering from the previous fight we see the hills converge
- In front of us, we see a black iron gate leading into a tunnel about 20ft. long ([[West Gate]])
- This appears very similar to the [[East Gate]] we saw when we first entered [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- A teenage boy in tattered cloths sits on one side of the gate, a tourniquet on his right bicep
	- He looks very scrawny

We all feel that this is likely an ambush
- [[Lionel]] takes a look around to see what he can see
- The boy at the gate is still breathing
- Something just doesn't feel right

We decide to draw weapons, making it look like we are ready for a fight
- Once we do this, many bushes and a tree come to life and start moving
- They wander away from the road and us
- This seems really strange to [[Effarig]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] 
	- [[Aeceran]] believes he has heard a story saying that these creatures will only attack if they can ambush 

Approaching the gate, it lets out a billow of steam and opens
- Now that we are closer, the teenager is clearly not just sleeping but is passed out

I go up to him to look at his injuries
- Trying to re-bandage his wounds I take off the tourniquet 
- This lets out a gush of blood and he looks bad
	- The tourniquet is now better but he lost a lot of blood 
- While I am doing this, I hear a crumple of paper and something sticking out of his shirt
	- There is a flyer advertising the Wolf's Head Jamboree  - [[wolfHeadJamboree.png|Flyer]]
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] guesses that the baron is the Baron of Vallaki 
- While this is happening [[Aeceran]] has his gaze fixed on the boy
- We think this may be the [[Brae Martikov|wereraven]] that that [[Revach]] hit with a spear [[2024-04-27#Mechanical Mantids]]
- He is not doing well but if we padded the wagon out he may still be able to travel with us

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't want to just leave him here
[[Aeceran]] does not want to drive the wagon if we do take him

Because he is close to death I want to be there if he passes
- Pad up the wagon and load up the boy
- Nobody but [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] notices [[Aeceran]] grab the old, bloody rag the boy had around his arm
- [[Aeceran]] hops up to ride with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], putting his hand around his waist
- [[Revach]] hands his bedroll over to help pad out the wagon

We continue on into the tunnel and it feels like we are driving over something harder
- Looking down there are plants that have grown over a metal floor
- There are gemstones in the ceiling bringing in light from outside making it look like stars

[[Lionel]] keeps doing work on the hooves as we travel while looking after the boy 

## [[The Windmill]] 
We make it to another split in the road, one going further North and another going East 
- About 1/4 of a mile to the East is a [[The Windmill|windmill]] 
- The blades are no longer covered in cloth and are falling apart, not moving in the wind 
- The door swings open and closed in the wind 

Anywhere that is out of the elements is better than on the side of the road 
- Head up to check out [[The Windmill]] and see if we can stay the night
- Approaching we get a better look at [[The Windmill]] and what is around it
	- There is a broken down stable next to it
	- The windows are dusty and don't quite fit the holes they are in
	- The blades are falling apart with no cloth on them 

[[Effarig]], [[Lionel]], and [[Revach]] decide to go in to see if it is safe
- The entry room is cluttered with baking supplies
- The whole place smells of burnt sugar and chicken poop which comes from a coop in the corner
- There is also a peddler's wagon in the corner 
- It is obvious that nobody has been here in a while 
- There is dust and dirt covering the floor

We hear a child's voice coming from up the stairs to the next level
- Sneaking up the stairs with [[Lionel]], there is a coat of what looks like flour all over the floor 
- The room is mostly full of the mill itself
	- The floor is covered in dust that seems to be flour
	- There are footprints through it but they are clearly very old

[[Effarig]] goes to inspect the millstone and when he approaches, two ghostly figures appear 
- One is a boy and the other is a girl
- One says, curious, "You are not the mean ladies" and they ask if we want to play
- Ask them why they are here and what happened to them 
	- The mean ladies made it so they can't leave 
	- The ladies fed them food to fatten them up
	- Once they were, the ladies killed them and made them watch as they ground their bones
	- [[Lionel]] looks down, clearly disgusted, before collecting a sample to look at later
- I feel heat, and a pull coming from the ring when I am near these ghosts
	- Trying to figure out how to let these souls pass I remember some things about ghosts 
	- Often souls with unfinished business or had some great wrong done against them 
	- They can be forced to pass on although the process is quite painful
	- Otherwise, whatever wrong was done must be righted
- They ask if we want to play with them, wanting to play catch with a rock they have
	- [[Lionel]] hasn't played catch before so [[Effarig]] and the kids show him how to do it
- The children ask if we are staying the night 
	- The mean ladies could be back at any time
- Ask how they were taken from their parents
	- They traded them for some pies 
	- See the girl grip the rock she was playing catch with and it gets divots in it where her finger tips are 
	- The pies made their parents happy
	- They are from [[Vallaki]] in a house near the edge of town, just inside the walls
- We finally get their names, [[Myrtle & Freek]]

Now the pull from [[Effarig]]'s ring is getting to be too much
- I decide to leave and check out the third floor 
- Ask [[Myrtle & Freek]] if it is safe and they said it should be
	- They say that is where the mean ladies kept them 
- Going up there is a small trapdoor in the ceiling and the gearshaft leading to the mill is shattered
- There is a small moldy bed with a chest next to it
- 3 large crates with latches resembling those for dogs
- I go to open the chest by the bed and it opens itself all the way revealing teeth 
	- One of the crates sprouts eyes and teeth before going after [[Effarig]] 

[[Aeceran]] was climbing [[The Windmill]] to see the surroundings before hearing the thump
- Him, [[Lionel]], and [[Revach]] rush to the third floor to help 
- These mimics grab and hold onto whatever they are hit with
- [[Effarig]] is grappled by one and bested, falling unconscious
- Shortly after [[Revach]] strikes the killing blow on the cage and the fight winds down
- [[Lionel]] stabilizes [[Effarig]] and sees shapes emerge as the chest melts into goo

After getting situated again [[Lionel]] returns upstairs to see what came out of the chest 
- Finds a little merry-go-round but instead of horses there are wolves chasing children 
	- On the bottom it says "Is no fun, is no Blinsky"
	- Assuming that this is the toy maker
- There is a flier for B.O.M. Bakery [[BOMbakery.png]]

[[Lionel]] hears a thump from the hatch above and quickly retreats to the second floor 
- [[Aeceran]] climbs out the window and up to see what is making the noise
- He sees a larger than average toad just chilling there before using Vicious Mockery and killing it
- He grabs it with mage hand and brings it back down to [[Lionel]] and [[Revach]] before asking how it could have gotten up there 

While he was up there, [[Aeceran]] sees a few things 
- To the North 
	- Can just see above the trees
	- Lake Zarovich and a small city, [[Vallaki]] 
- To the West 
	- A limestone colored castle with some towers
	- Some are collapsed while others are still standing with spire (wizard tower) hoods
	- Small buildings further South along the Luna River

[[Lionel]] says that they should move on and stay the night elsewhere
- Concered about being turned into pies like [[Myrtle & Freek]] 
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says he has no idea what B.O.M. bakery is
	- He hasn't been to [[Vallaki]] in nearly 7 years 
	- He says that mean old ladies has to be better than the elements 
- [[Lionel]] is convinced and they stay there for the night 

On their watch, [[Lionel]] speaks with [[Revach]] about the specter that appears when he fights 
- Is it his wife - Yes 
- They met when she was performing at the inn in Traebor, she was a performer of sorts 
- It apparently didn't take long for him to woo her 
- When asked how long they were together [[Revach]] says not long enough

While knocked unconscious [[Effarig]] feels something similar to the last time he was 
- It feels like he is floating in oblivion
- It is the same space he was before but without the presence 

## Back on the Road 
Waking up we speak with [[Myrtle & Freek]] again, briefly
- They give the names of their parents, Nela and Gorek Entin

Thinking about what the mean old ladies could be, [[Aeceran]] only remembers stories about creatures and evil woman in the woods

[[Lionel]] has finished the broken horse shoes
- They are put on the horse and it seems eager to get going, feeling better than before 

We mount up and get going, moving faster than before 
- The morning and afternoon go by without much going on
- We realize that the kid we have brought with us should have regained consciousness by now but he is still asleep
	- His breathing is now consistent and he flinches when his bandages are replaced

[[Lionel]] begins working on smelling salts for [[Effarig]] 
- [[Effarig]] is concerned that he isn't strong enough and wants something to help 
- He asks [[Lionel]] to make him something based off his beast blood that will make him stronger 
- Watching him do this, [[Lionel]] is able to separate different portions of his blood out with the red and gold stones
- Looking at it, the glow from the gold one is similar to healing spells from the clergy

[[Aeceran]] swaps driving the cart with [[Effarig]] to check on the kid in the back 
- He holds up the old tourniquet that [[Effarig]] left when changing bandages up to [[Lionel]] and asks him to smell it
	- [[Lionel]] can tell that it smells faintly like poultry
	- While they are talking about this, [[Lionel]] sees the boy looking through his eyelashes before closing his eyes 
- [[Aeceran]] says "We know you're awake"
	- The boy turns, waking up seeming annoyed
	- Ask him what he knows and the last thing he remembers is waking up in the cart
	- He was on his way out of [[Vallaki]] and says the flyer for the Wolf's Head Jamboree is something he got last week
	- He left because he heard there were new people in [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] and he wanted to see 
		- This comes from his dad, Urwin Martikov who is the [[Innkeeper's Family|innkeeper]] in [[Vallaki]] 
	- [[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] discuss things in elvish before the boy responds knowing what they are saying 
		- He shouldn't know elvish because there are no elves in [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
		- His father taught him so they can talk about patrons at the inn 
- The kid confirms that he was the wereraven that [[Revach]] hit ([[2024-04-27#Mechanical Mantids]])
	- He says something that confirms it but denies it like a teenager would
- Finally learn his name is [[Brae Martikov]] 

## The Abandoned Church 
With the faster horses it is a lot bumpier in the cart

We are now only a few miles out of [[Vallaki]] 
- Suddenly we see a silver light start to flash in the woods
- It seems to notice us and rushes over and crosses the road 
- It begins to circle some trees, marking a path we hadn't noticed before 
- While discussing what we will do, the light turns into a symbol of [[Church Of Lethander#Lethander]]

Decide to follow it because anything from [[Church Of Lethander#Lethander]] can't be bad 
- [[Aeceran]] says he doesn't have a great relationship with the gods
	- [[Effarig]] tells [[Aeceran]] that he noticed an aura of undead on him
	- [[Aeceran]] denies any knowledge of this, genuinely confused
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] want to stay on the road with the cart
- Go down the narrow path for about half a mile until it opens to a clearing

The orb dances around crumbled stone walls 
- A stone door lays flat under where it would have stood
- The whole building is notably shaped like a chapel
- Going inside, there is an alter in the middle of the room
	- The bottom of it is a rounded bowl and a symbol of [[Church Of Lethander#Lethander]] sits above it
	- On the back it reads in old common, "I run smoother than most any rhyme, I love to fall but cannot climb. In the hands of light, many devils I can fight."
- [[Effarig]] feels a chill and realizes this is desecrated ground 

We believe the riddle refers to water or more specifically, holy water 
- [[Lionel]] pours some water from his water skin 
	- After 15 seconds the water seeps in
	- [[Lionel]] hears very faintly a whistle of steam like a tea kettle
- We try again with just a few drops of holy water and the whistle is louder this time
	- The orb blinks rapidly a few times before swirling around us and disappearing
	- Zombies emerge from the cemetery and forest around us

We take care of the zombies that are very liquid-y like they were in [[2024-04-20#The Coming of Strahd von Zarovich Strahd]]
- Go to check out the alter
- There is white mist coming from a pinprick hole in a tile near the alter 
- We are able to pry the tile up

###### LOOT
- [x] Distributed - 
A case full of vials of holy water,
A device with a hose attached that looks like a vacuum

[[Lionel]] looks at the device to see what it does 
- It appears to mist whatever liquid is attached to it
- There is a chamber inside it with a purple mist that mixes with the liquid 
- It will allow the user to consecrate a 25x25 area instead of a 5x5 with one bottle of holy water 

Because he can now easily do it, [[Effarig]] wants to consecrate this desecrated area before we leave 
- [[Lionel]] sees a slot that looks like one of his gems would fit 
- Adding the pulsing silver light to the device the holy water will spread over an even larger 50x50 area 
	- It does consume some of the charges that are on the gem 

###### RULES THINGS 
Consecration has no official rules so these are the ones for the campaign
- Nothing can be raised from the dead in that area
- Undead can enter the area but they have disadvantage on attacks and saving throws

[[Effarig]] consecrates the chapel and the graves after putting the zombies back in the graves 

[[Aeceran]], curious as to what would happen, steps into the area without anyone noticing
- He feels fine at first before becoming terribly light headed

[[Lionel]] and [[Effarig]] work together to harvest some things from the zombies 
- 4 Phials of Congealed Blood 
- 1 Undying Flesh
