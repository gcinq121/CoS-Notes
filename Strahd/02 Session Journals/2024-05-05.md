## The Gate to the West
It is early afternoon after we defeat the mantis automata, about 2:00
- [[Aeceran]] guesses we can reach where the road turns East before we need to rest
- I continue helping the horse pull along the wagon
- [[Lionel]] continues work on the mechanism for the horses hooves

As we rest, recovering from the previous fight we see the hills converge
- In front of us, we see a black iron gate leading into a tunnel about 20ft. long ([[West Gate]])
- This appears very similar to the [[East Gate]] we saw when we first entered [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- A teenage boy in tattered cloths sits on one side of the gate, a tourniquet on his right bicep
	- He looks very scrawny

We all feel that this is likely an ambush
- [[Lionel]] takes a look around to see what he can see
- The boy at the gate is still breathing
- Something just doesn't feel right

We decide to draw weapons, making it look like we are ready for a fight
- Once we do this, many bushes and a tree come to life and start moving
- They wander away from the road and us
- This seems really strange to [[Effarig]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] 
	- [[Aeceran]] believes he has heard a story saying that these creatures will only attack if they can ambush 

Approaching the gate, it lets out a billow of steam and opens
- Now that we are closer, the teenager is clearly not just sleeping but is passed out

I go up to him to look at his injuries
- Trying to re-bandage his wounds I take off the tourniquet 
- This lets out a gush of blood and he looks bad
	- The tourniquet is now better but he lost a lot of blood 
- While I am doing this, I hear a crumple of paper and something sticking out of his shirt
	- There is a flyer advertising the Wolf's Head Jamboree  - [[wolfHeadJamboree.png|Flyer]]
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] guesses that the baron is the Baron of Vallaki 
- While this is happening [[Aeceran]] has his gaze fixed on the boy
- We think this may be the raven that that [[Revach]] hit with a spear [[2024-04-27#Mechanical Mantids]]
- He is not doing well but if we padded the wagon out he may still be able to travel with us

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't want to just leave him here
[[Aeceran]] does not want to drive the wagon if we do take him

Because he is close to death I want to be there if he passes
- Pad up the wagon and load up the boy
- Nobody but [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] notices [[Aeceran]] grab the old, bloody rag the boy had around his arm
- [[Aeceran]] hops up to ride with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], putting his hand around his waist
- [[Revach]] hands his bedroll over to help pad out the wagon

We continue on into the tunnel and it feels like we are driving over something harder
- Looking down there are plants that have grown over a metal floor
- There are gemstones in the ceiling bringing in light from outside making it look like stars

[[Lionel]] keeps doing work on the hooves as we travel while looking after the boy 

## [[The Windmill]] 
We make it to another split in the road, one going further North and another going East 
- About 1/4 of a mile to the East is a [[The Windmill|windmill]] 
- The blades are no longer covered in cloth and are falling apart, not moving in the wind 
- The door swings open and closed in the wind 

Anywhere that is out of the elements is better than on the side of the road 
- Head up to check out [[the windmill]] and see if we can stay the night
- Approaching we get a better look at [[The Windmill]] and what is around it
	- There is a broken down stable next to it
	- The windows are dusty and don't quite fit the holes they are in
	- The blades are falling apart with no cloth on them 

[[Effarig]], [[Lionel]], and [[Revach]] decide to go in to see if it is safe
- The entry room is cluttered with baking supplies
- The whole place smells of burnt sugar and chicken poop which comes from a coop in the corner
- There is also a peddler's wagon in the corner 
- It is obvious that nobody has been here in a while 
- There is dust and dirt covering the floor

We hear a child's voice coming from up the stairs to the next level
- Sneaking up the stairs with [[Lionel]], there is a coat of what looks like flour all over the floor 
- The room is mostly full of the mill itself
	- The floor is covered in dust that seems to be flour
	- There are footprints through it but they are clearly very old

[[Effarig]] goes to inspect the millstone and when he approaches, two ghostly figures appear 
- One is a boy and the other is a girl
- One says, curious, "You are not the mean ladies" and they ask if we want to play
- Ask them why they are here and what happened to them 
	- The mean ladies made it so they can't leave 
	- The ladies fed them food to fatten them up
	- Once they were, the ladies killed them and made them watch as they ground their bones
	- [[Lionel]] looks down, clearly disgusted, before collecting a sample to look at later
- I feel heat, and a pull coming from the ring when I am near these ghosts
	- Trying to figure out how to let these souls pass I remember some things about ghosts 
	- Often souls with unfinished business or had some great wrong done against them 
	- They can be forced to pass on although the process is quite painful
	- Otherwise, whatever wrong was done must be righted
- They ask if we want to play with them, wanting to play catch with a rock they have
	- [[Lionel]] hasn't played catch before so [[Effarig]] and the kids show him how to do it
- The children ask if we are staying the night 
	- The mean ladies could be back at any time
