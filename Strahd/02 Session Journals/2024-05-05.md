## The Gate to the West
It is early afternoon after we defeat the mantis automata, about 2:00
- [[Aeceran]] guesses we can reach where the road turns East before we need to rest
- I continue helping the horse pull along the wagon
- [[Lionel]] continues work on the mechanism for the horses hooves

As we rest, recovering from the previous fight we see the hills converge
- In front of us, we see a black iron gate leading into a tunnel about 20ft. long ([[West Gate]])
- This appears very similar to the [[East Gate]] we saw when we first entered [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- A teenage boy in tattered cloths sits on one side of the gate, a tourniquet on his right bicep
	- He looks very scrawny

We all feel that this is likely an ambush
- [[Lionel]] takes a look around to see what he can see
- The boy at the gate is still breathing
- Something just doesn't feel right

We decide to draw weapons, making it look like we are ready for a fight
- Once we do this, many bushes and a tree come to life and start moving
- They wander away from the road and us
- This seems really strange to [[Effarig]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] 
	- [[Aeceran]] believes he has heard a story saying that these creatures will only attack if they can ambush 

Approaching the gate, it lets out a billow of steam and opens
- Now that we are closer, the teenager is clearly not just sleeping but is passed out

I go up to him to look at his injuries
- Trying to re-bandage his wounds I take off the tourniquet 
- This lets out a gush of blood and he looks bad
	- The tourniquet is now better but he lost a lot of blood 
- While I am doing this, I hear a crumple of paper and something sticking out of his shirt
	- There is a flyer advertising the Wolf's Head Jamboree  - [[wolfHeadJamboree.png|Flyer]]
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] guesses that the baron is the Baron of Vallaki 
- While this is happening [[Aeceran]] has his gaze fixed on the boy
- We think this may be the raven that that [[Revach]] hit with a spear [[2024-04-27#Mechanical Mantids]]
- He is not doing well but if we padded the wagon out he may still be able to travel with us

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't want to just leave him here
[[Aeceran]] does not want to drive the wagon if we do take him

Because he is close to death I want to be there if he passes
- Pad up the wagon and load up the boy
- Nobody but [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] notices [[Aeceran]] grab the old, bloody rag the boy had around his arm
- [[Aeceran]] hops up to ride with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], putting his hand around his waist
- [[Revach]] hands his bedroll over to help pad out the wagon

We continue on into the tunnel and it feels like we are driving over something harder
- Looking down there are plants that have grown over a metal floor
- There are gemstones in the ceiling bringing in light from outside making it look like stars

Lionel keeps doing work on the hooves as we travel while looking after the boy 

## The Windmill 
We make it to another split in the road, one going further North and another going East 
- About 1/4 of a mile to the East is a windmill 
- The blades are no longer covered in cloth and are falling apart, not moving in the wind 
- The door swings open and closed in the wind 

Anywhere that is out of the elements is better than on the side of the road 
- Head up to check out the windmill and see if we can stay the night
