## The Gate to the West
It is early afternoon after we defeat the mantis automata, about 2:00
- [[Aeceran]] guesses we can reach where the road turns East before we need to rest
- I continue helping the horse pull along the wagon
- [[Lionel]] continues work on the mechanism for the horses hooves

As we rest, recovering from the previous fight we see the hills converge
- In front of us, we see a black iron gate leading into a tunnel about 20ft. long ([[West Gate]])
- This appears very similar to the [[East Gate]] we saw when we first entered [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- A teenage boy in tattered cloths sits on one side of the gate, a tourniquet on his right bicep
	- He looks very scrawny

We all feel that this is likely an ambush
