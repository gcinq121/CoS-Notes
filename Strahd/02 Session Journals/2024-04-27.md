## In Search Of Safety
Leaving [[Madam Eva]]'s tent, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] talks with [[Effarig]] saying that the fortune did not include his and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s fate
- He asks what the party's next plans are
- The party is going to talk and decide what are next steps are
- There is a city called [[Vallaki]] that is a two days ride away
	- It is a walled city that is supposedly safe from [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] approaches [[Revach]], but all [[Effarig]] can make out is that she looks concerned

About half an hour later [[Vistani Elder|The Elder]] leaves [[Madam Eva]]'s tent saying that she needs to rest for a few days
- He has never seen a reading take this much out of her before
- When she is ready they will leave
	- They will leave someone or a note here to indicate where they went
- He offers a tent to the party 
	- [[Effarig]] and [[Revach]] accept while [[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] opt to sleep in the carriage

Getting ready and setting off in the morning, [[Aeceran]] asks [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] why [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] would be after [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
- He says something about a woman named Tatyana that [[Effarig]] cannot make out

[[Lionel]] makes his way over to [[Effarig]], looking scruffy
- He asks  [[Effarig]] to teach him how to shave since he hasn't had to do it before 
- While learning he asks how [[Effarig]] learned to shave and he tells him how most would, from his father
	- It was a good memory

[[Vistani Elder|The Elder]] hands the party rations for the road 
- We can't say that they didn't feed us
- Don't look too deep into the reading, some can get lost looking for its meaning
	- Often you don't know what it means until something happens 
- He says the injured horse should stay with the [[Vistani]] until it is healed but they will happily return it when it is

The party sets off with myself at the front of the carriage taking some weight off our one horse 
- We can go directly North and try to make it up a steep cliff or loop back south for a more measured gradient
- We opt to go the longer but safer route

## The Start to [[Vallaki]] 
The trip starts easily enough and we make it to where we can see the beautiful Mount Ghakis
- As we gaze there is an avalanche tumbling down the side 
- Cannot escape the omnipresent castle to the north 

As we are going along hearing the brush in the wind, we hear a twig snap
- In the forest twigs and branches start to amass together and rush at us
- They are fairly weak and we quickly take care of them
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is attacked and hurt during the fight causing [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to back up their horse and leave the fighting to the party 

After the fight [[Aeceran]] sees a raven that is looking at us and tries to kill it
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] warns him that killing ravens is bad luck
- They are the watchers of [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] remarks that we should get going before more stick things come
- He has seen ones as big as the trees

[[Revach]] says he wishes his maul was an axe

Make it to a long stone bridge above Tser Falls which is 1000 ft. below
- On each corner are perched gargoyles
- [[Lionel]] and [[Revach]] go to check it out
	- The gargoyles are covered in moss and their facial features are worn
	- They have been there for a long time
	- The ones on the south side are hunched over with their wings tucked
- On the other side the gargoyles have their wings spread

As we continue we pass the road to the east in a valley, leading to the castle and feel a chill

## Mechanical Mantids
Come around a bend and see a well on the side of the road 
- There is no roof and the rope for the bucket is burned
- See a light emerging from down in the well
- The water is 20ft. down and there is a handle 10ft. past that
- 
[[Lionel]] makes a makeshift grappling hook to try and grab the handle 
- There is no resistance when the hook hits the water, like it is an illusion
- It doesn't quite work and is locked too tight

[[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] climb down and when they hit the water the illusion breaks
- They find a trapdoor
- [[Lionel]] tries to pick the lock and finds that there is something jamming it

Everyone who is strong takes turns trying to open the hatch
- Eventually [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] makes his way down and cracks it before climbing back out

I go down with [[Lionel]] and see 4 suits of armor in each corner of the room
- The floor is metallic and there is a bear rug covering some of the floor
- [[Lionel]] inspects the automatons after checking the doors in the room
	- Finds a water receptacle where they would be powered from
	- Does not look like these have been powered on in a long time

Enter the door to the East and it appears to be a lab
- All the glassware is smashed and burned notes are scattered around 
- There is a notably nice looking painting on the back wall 
- On the back wall there are alcoves containing more automatons that are silver and look like mantises 
- Silver feathers are scattered around with the burnt notes and [[Lionel]] collects them

The door to the West is a bedroom
- There is a small and a large bed as well as a fox and a bear rug
- Two skeletons are in the back corner by the larger bed 
	- The larger is missing one hand has a small book with journal entries [[DrVadimChakovJournal.png|Journal]]
		- These talk about waiting for a battle and trying to make automatons to fight 
		- It was too difficult to complete them in time
		- Says there is a safe in the lab room

[[Lionel]] finds the safe behind the painting in the next room
- It has a hand print lock which he puts his hand in while [[Effarig]], [[Aeceran]], and [[Revach]] tell him that is probably not a good idea
- This awakes all the automaton and we fight 

[[Effarig]] goes unconscious during the fight 
- I hear a voice as it reverberates though me
- "A choice lies before you. Swear yourself to me and carry my power."
	- This is something that has been searching for someone to wield it
	- No idea what it is but it is not good aligned
- Before he can say anything he is brought back by [[Lionel]] 

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] comes down to help us because it is rough
- [[Revach]], trying to keep his rage spears a raven in a tree
	- It falls out and turns into a man, securing it as a Wereraven
	- It runs away, turning back into a raven and flying North
- With his help we all make it out and [[Revach]] throws the last javelin

Head back down the well to try and figure out the lock 
- Remember that the skeleton was missing a right hand 
- Under the mattress is a jar of green fluid
	- This contains a perfectly preserved embalmed hand 

Take this to the vault and open it

[[Lionel]] also harvests some materials from the automatons 
	- 6 plating
	- 4 gears
	- 6 phial of oil
	- 2 springs
	- He also would be able to create an automatons

We all limp back to the carriage and continue on hoping to not encounter anything else
