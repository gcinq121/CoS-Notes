## Meeting [[Revach]]
[[Effarig]] has been traveling and just spent the night in an inn in [[Amphail]]
- Awoken to the sound of fighting downstairs 
- Run down and see a dude with no armor on fighting two armored soldiers
- The soldiers yell and call this man a deserter

[[Effarig]] helps this man and they defeat the two [[Shadar-kai]] soldiers that were after him
- A raven's skull drops from the belt of one of the soldiers and it replays a message about getting to this man before he gets to something
- I know that the [[Shadar-kai]] usually praise the Raven Queen who has their souls sent back to bodies to continue fighting

After defeating the enemies I feel a pull from the [[Gold & Silver Ring]] with an urge to cut up the bodies
The man I fought beside introduces himself as [[Revach]]
Knowing the importance of having these men rest, I report the deaths to the local [[Church Of Lethander]]  and although confused they agree to bury these men

Ask [[Revach]] where he plans to go and it seems we are both headed to the [[Stonewing Inn]]
- Since we are both going the same way might as well travel together and we head off

## Meeting [[Lionel]] 
After a long day of travel we are cooking up dinner and we see someone with a big backpack clanking down the road
- He says what we are cooking smells good and asks to join
- As he approaches he is stunned seeing us and looks to [[Revach]] and looks down to the [[Gold & Silver Ring]]
- After some hesitancy he introduces himself as [[Lionel]]
- He seems odd and sets up a bit far from us and pulls out weird equipment
- See a pulsing red glow from where he is

The next morning say goodbyes only to find he is going to the [[Stonewing Inn]] as well and has very specific coordinates
- Deciding that the more the merrier we all travel together

## Into [[Phandalin]]
Make it to [[Phandalin]] 
- The streets are clean and there are no beggars
- Something feels off about the place
	- There is a feeling that necromancy has been around

Wander and come across the [[Stonewing Inn]] 
- It is very popular and crowded with no dark corners
- There are carvings in the walls that depict many adventures
- See high elf on the stage with a fire genasi performing, the elf dancing while the genasi plays

The high elf makes their way over saying that they have been waiting for us and the tarot card of the King of Charisma flips out on the table as well as the three that the high elf had
- They depict perfect pictures of each of us and I am labeled "Judgement"

The high elf introduces himself as [[Aeceran]] 
Him and [[Lionel]] talk about why they are here
- [[Aeceran]] wants revenge, [[Lionel]] a teacher

While they speak a fog creeps in from the door and windows
- As it reaches people they slow down and stop moving
- The fog avoids the four of us and [[Aeceran]] says it is fine

[[Aeceran]] says that we are going to [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] and that once we are there we cannot go back 
We go outside and see that the whole town is covered with a low fog 

## To [[03 Barovia|Barovia]]
See a carriage and two horses
- The carriage appears to be heavily reinforced and made for long travel and off-roading

[[Aeceran]] explains that when you travel through the mist you usually go back to where you came from
- We head South to meet with the Traebor Trail 
- Go off road and go further North
- The fog gets very thick only able to see 10ft in front of the wagon

After a while the horses stop and it feels like we are on a precipice like if they go any further we will fall off a cliff
- [[Aeceran]] says this is really the last chance to turn back
- We all decide to continue 
- See shadowy skeletal hands in the distance
- Hear a child giggle in the distance 

## Arrival at the [[East Gate]] 
Arrive to a set of gates made of metal on a paved path
- The bricks are deeply inlayed
- The cogs that are part of the gate come to life in a puff of steam and the gate opens

We move through the gate and out of the mist hearing the cries of wolves and caws of ravens
Continue on until we see a body that lies in the middle of the road
- Looking out there are eyes in the woods around us
- Take out my sword and cast Light as I approach the body
- The eyes emerge from the forest as wolves and begin to tear into the body
- They seem to ignore us at the moment until we hear a whinny from the horses behind us
- Go back and take care of the wolves although one of the horses ends up wounded
- Hear a voice after we kill them - "Maybe you aren't rodents"

Help [[Aeceran]] decapitate the wolves at his advice and sprinkle holy water on them
Inspecting the body it has been there for days, suspiciously untouched by anything
- Has an envelope that falls out of their cloths when we investigate
	- Sealed with the letter "K"
- It is from [[Kolyan Indirovich]] the [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]]  of the [[Village of Barovia]] asking for anyone who can help his daughter, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] who has been afflicted by a sickness
- Find a map of [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- [[Aeceran]] says we need to make it to the [[Tser Pool Camp|Tser Pool]] in the river to the West North West before we set out again

## The [[Village of Barovia]]
There are many more graves than looks like there need to be for the current population
See a decrepit [[Church Of Lethander]] and feel a pull from the ring in that direction ([[Barovia Church of Lethander]])
There is a small [[Barovia Inn|inn]] once we enter town and we see a large [[Barovia Manor|manor]] on the hill above town with the side caved in
There is only one person roaming the streets at this time
- All the others are peeking though their blinds at us

[[Revach]] says that he heard crying through the streets and despite my protests the party follow it to a house
- The woman inside is noticeably distraught with unknown people opening her door
- She appears to have been crying for quite a while 
- We are invited in and we come to know her as [[Mad Mary]] 
	- She asks if we have seen a young woman, 17
	- Her daughter ran away from home a few days ago and she is looking for her 
	- Tt appears that at least some of her grief is really 

After consoling the woman and asserting that we will keep an eye out [[Aeceran]] goes into the street and knocks on a door
- He says he wants to ask a question about the [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]] and what is wrong with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
- Hear arguing and hushed tones from the cracked door
- [[Aeceran]] says the [[Strahd von Zarovich|lord of the land]], [[Strahd von Zarovich]], has taken interest in her and she is going mad 
	- He continues to explain that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is a [[Vampires|vampire]] and has ruled [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] for centuries 
	- I remember that [[Vampires]] have the abilities to control animals, make thralls, mind control, cannot enter homes unless invited, and don't like daylight
	- The thing about garlic is fake

Decide since it is late to hit the [[Barovia Inn]] and see if we can learn any more there
- On the way see a woman knocking on doors trying to sell cakes

Go in and meet the [[Innkeeper's Family|Innkeeper]], [[Innkeeper's Family|Alexi]] 
- He is bald and clean shaven
- In the inn there is a [[Vistani]] couple with a daughter and two trappers in a corner
- The [[Innkeeper's Family|Innkeeper]] asks us for crowns to pay for rooms and we are confused except for [[Aeceran]] 
	- He explains that crowns are stamped electrum pieces with the visage of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] on it
	- It will be hard to exchange them for the gold we have
- [[Innkeeper's Family|Alexi]] asks where we came from and we tell him the [[East Gate]] 
	- He says nobody has come through there in a long time
- He notices my robes and asks what god I serve
	- I tell him one similar to the one they have there and is kind of about the celebration of life
	- Since I am a holy man he has a favor to ask 
		- A year ago, a wizard gathered some people to go to [[Castle Ravenloft|the castle]] and demand [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] change things up
		- The wizard and most people were struck down and murdered
		- One of these people was the [[Gregori Donavich|priest]]'s son who was brought back to life 
		- [[Innkeeper's Family|Alexi]] asks to help bring the son to rest
- [[Lionel]] asks the [[Innkeeper's Family|Innkeeper]] for any stories about [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- [[Revach]] notices there is another person behind the bar who has nothing behind their eyes
	- They polish glass after glass and when they are done they go back to the beginning
	- [[Aeceran]] says this has something to do with the Plague of Soullessness

Once we decide to call it a night [[Aeceran]] asks to meet in one room before we go to sleep
- He says we cannot tell anyone else that they know the area since they are an elf

## The Coming of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
Awake to a screech coming from the [[Barovia Manor|manor]]
- There is a bright light coming from it
- The roof is on fire and there are undead trying to get into the front gates

[[Aeceran]] runs out and waits only a minute for the rest of the party to be ready for combat
We dash to the front gate and see a person floating outside the second level of the [[Barovia Manor|Manor]] 
- [[Aeceran]] climbs the [[Barovia Manor|manor]] wall and hides on top and assisting the rest take care of the zombies
- The floating man is calling out, "Come to me, let me in"
- These zombies are different than the ones [[Effarig]] knows
	- more liquid and malleable
- [[Lionel]] calls out to the figure, being snarky and assuming it is [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] before getting lit up by a beam of moonlight

After taking care of the zombies I break down the boards over the front gate and we all rush in
- Going inside and up the stairs to the second level where we see shadows and a werewolf fighting with two men that are trying to get a woman away from the figure through the collapsed wall
	- The werewolf is strange, not as animated as it should be
	- One of the men is fighting off the enemies and falls so the other throws the woman into a room a runs over
		- he looks no older than mid 20s and has royal features
We all take care of the minions and are thanked by the man for our help
- He introduces himself as [[Ismark Kolyanovich]], the son of the [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]] 
- Give the [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]] a healing potion and he is brought back up
[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says this has taken too much time and there are other things that he needs to attend to
- He flies away and we see him reform as a ring of fire above the village 
- "Rats have infested their village and the daughter should be brought to him within 3 days or else everyone will die"
	- ==This is very concerning, they need me by their side if this is to happen==
Looking to the village, we see torches light and start to meet
- They will be at the [[Barovia Manor|Manor]] in 10 minutes

## The Escape
The [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]] asks why we are in [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] and what [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] said
- Since we are the only ones he can trust he will help us get his children out of there 
- [[Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] sends [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to ready the horses and brings the party to give them supplies
- In his office under a rug is a trapdoor which opens to reveal a chest

###### LOOT
- [x] Distributed
150ep, a blunderbuss, some ammo, a large arm cannon (broken)

[[Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] Insists on staying and trying to reason with the mob
Realizing the mob is approaching quickly, [[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] decide to return to town to try and get our horses and carriage 
- To keep [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] safe, myself and [[Revach]] mount up and leave immediately with the siblings
- [[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] can see there are 30-40 people in the mob and [[Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] tries to stop them and speak with them
	- The last they see is him being run down by the mob

While the two are getting the horses ready a little girl emerges holding a sword to [[Aeceran]] 
- Shortly after, the girl's mother comes out and reveals themselves as [[Innkeeper's Family#Alexi]] and [[Innkeeper's Family#Katerina]]
- [[Aeceran]] tells them about the [[Vistani]] camp at [[Tser Pool Camp|Tser Pool]] and if they want to keep their family safe, convince [[Innkeeper's Family#Ivan]] to pack up and go there 
- [[Innkeeper's Family#Alexi]] begins to pack immediately and the two of the party finish preparing the horses and carriage 

## The Road to [[Tser Pool Camp|Tser Pool]]
The party all eventually meet up and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks if the two in the carriage saw anything of his father
- They just say they saw him trying to reason with the mob
[[Aeceran]] tells them we are going to a [[Vistani]] camp by [[Tser Pool Camp|Tser Pool]]
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] objects saying that the [[Vistani]] are servants of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] but sees it is his only opton

We decide it is too dangerous to rest for the night and continue on until the morning 
- Find a dip off the road that is secluded and you cannot see unless you are on top of it
- Take a long rest before continuing
- [[Effarig]] dreams of being stuck in the mansion with the flames rising higher
	- He does not awake feeling rested

The horses hoof is still injured but it will heal in a week
- Because of this we will travel slightly slower
- [[Effarig]] joins the horses at the front of the cart to take some of the weight

As we travel on the next afternoon there is a pack of ravens that is keeping pace with us
Take a turn on the road towards where the [[Tser Pool Camp|vistani camp]] will be
[[Effarig]] overhears [[Aeceran]] talk about his time in the circus
Come across a grave at the side of the road that appears exhumed
- There is a symbol of [[Church Of Lethander#Lethander]] on the headstone
- Looking in, [[Effarig]] sees a corpse, completely skeletal 
- [[Lionel]] looks into the grave and steps back, shocked
	- He explains that he saw himself in the grave, dead and pale though not gone more than a day 

After this shock we continue on as night falls 
- Hear a call from the trees
	- "You can run but you cannot hide. Bring me Tatyana"
- Two blue devils and a swarm of bats appear before the party 
- The fight is hard and the others reveal their afflictions during
	- In a panic, [[Lionel]] injects something into himself before transforming into a monstrous amalgam
		- He grows larger and fur covers his body before his bones creak and stretch, pushing their way though the fur 
		- This beast lets out shrieking whistles that gnaw at your ears
	- Seemingly away from the fight, a spirit appears behind [[Revach]] 
		- She follows him closely in his movements, a spectral belladonna
		- Once the commotion of the fight is over, [[Revach]] begins to hit himself before the ghost fades away

[[Lionel]] begins to thrash and writhe in his new form, screaming and whistling
- I hold my sword up to him and swiftly pull out my holy water 
- [[Aeceran]] cautiously approaches [[Lionel]] and puts his hand on his face, trying to get him to relax
- [[Lionel]] shrinks back to his original form, skin welding together over bone revealing his original self in tattered clothes
	- He thanks [[Aeceran]] before crawling to the carriage, opening his pack, and voraciously going at his rations

We set off again, changed as a party 
- I return to the front of the carriage and put up my hood to see if [[Revach]] or [[Lionel]] are in any way undead 
- To my surprise the only thing that lights up is [[Aeceran]] who gives off only the slightest aura, like he has been around undead recently

## The [[Tser Pool Camp|Vistani Camp]]
We continue until we see the light of a fire in the distance with a large number of wagons surrounding it
- Once we arrive we see they are cooking a large deer over the fire 
- A man who appears to be the leader of the 20 or so [[Vistani]] there calls out to [[Aeceran]] calling them the "Bringer of heros"
- "[[Madam Eva]]" is currently resting

[[Vistani Elder|The Elder]] does introductions and invites us all to sit down and rest
- This is the first place where we all have felt joy

#### [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s Story
[[Vistani Elder|The Elder]] begins to recount the story of the [[Vistani]] and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
- They are travelers and healers that are gathering stories 
- There was once an advanced civilization that burned to the ground
- They saved a man who they thought was surely dead
	- He recovered and traveled with them for a long time
	- They never really knew who he was and never asked any questions
	- One day soldiers came and told the [[Vistani]] they were harboring a foreign prince and they would all die if they didn't give him up
	- The prince fought off 20 of the soldiers by  himself before introducing himself as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] 
- He decided to call [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] his domain and invited his parents to see what he had done
	- Shortly after their arrival they died 
	- Later on his wedding night, his brother and betrothed died as well
	- He fell into darkness, becoming a [[Vampires|Vampire]] 
- [[Madam Eva]] brings adventurers to [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] to try and purge the darkness from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s heart
	- Thought this was done and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] defeated 50 years ago but he came back 

Through this story he references Mother Night as as god and she seems similar to The [[Church of Kelemvor#Kelemvor]] 

Once [[Vistani Elder|The Elder]] finishes the story he says that [[Madam Eva]] is ready to see us and we head to a tent

## The Fate of [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
The party enters [[Madam Eva]]'s tent
- [[Aeceran]] is called "Little Viper"
- [[Revach]] is called "Little Raven"
	- She says he should be angry for what they took from him 
- She asks [[Effarig]] if he will be a hawk or a vulture, watching from afar or tearing apart the bodies 
	- "What will you do to bring your god here?" "Whatever I have to"
- She mentions a name, directed at [[Revach]] after which he leaves
	- We can only do the reading with everyone there
	- Telling him that nothing is lost in [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] will get him to return 

[[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] do some persuading and eventually, [[Revach]] reenters the tent

#### The Reading 
[[Madam Eva]] pulls out a deck of cards and shuffles as all of the cards representing us fly our of our pockets and into the deck
- She lays out 5 cards before pausing and laying out two more

	- He says she is very tired and needs to rest before disappearing into the tent
