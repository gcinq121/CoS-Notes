oneLiner: Illusionary vampires take on the party, Aeceran and Effarig clash, and we get in too deep to not do a heist
---
## Illusionary [[Vampires]] 
[[Effarig]] sees sets of red eyes appear across the street with [[Aeceran]] and the strange man behind him
- [[Revach]] and [[Lionel]] rush out as three [[Vampires]] run out to take on the party 
- [[Aeceran]] backs off and the strange man runs away down the street 
	- [[Aeceran]] really isn't in control of himself and his consciousness is poofed away somewhere else
- The [[Vampires]] are very tough and taunt us
	- Their wounds heal extremely fast
	- Using the [[Magic Mister]] only delays the healing
	- Their attacks are extremely effective against us
- [[Effarig]] is in a rage doing anything he can to strike down these undead
- Eventually our minds clear as the [[Vampires]] fade away into nothing and [[Effarig]] feels a bite on his neck
	- Still crazed, he turns around and strikes down [[Aeceran]] with a slash and a cannon shot
	- [[Lionel]] rushes over to stabilize [[Aeceran]] as [[Effarig]] falls to the ground, barely holding on

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] were awoken by the fighting
- They rush out to ask what happened saying we were fighting nothing 
- [[Effarig]] insists [[Aeceran]] bit his neck although there is no wound
- [[Aeceran]] and [[Effarig]] are helped back into [[St. Andral's Church]] as we collapse, exhausted

In the morning [[Aeceran]] wakes up and starts to rush over to fight [[Effarig]] 
- [[Aeceran]] seems not all there for the moment before the fog seems to clear
- He is stopped by the others before hissing and showing his teeth with pointed canines 
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] also sees the teeth 
- Back on the other side of the church, [[Lionel]] tells [[Aeceran]] what happened to us
	- We were tricked into seeing [[Vampires]] attacking us
	- [[Aeceran]] is still not all there only absorbing half of it
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] goes over to [[Revach]] and [[Effarig]] and asks what happened last night
	- [[Revach]] tells him that we were tricked and were fighting illusions
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks [[Effarig]] what happened and he says [[Aeceran]] bit him 
		- With no wound present there is no evidence
		- [[Effarig]] asserts that he knows what happened, sure of himself 
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] tries to impress that we can still trust [[Aeceran]] 
		- He hasn't done anything to move against us
- [[Effarig]] moves to be by himself at the front of the church and pray

[[Aeceran]] goes outside and begins to explain to [[Lionel]] what happened to him 
- He was taken away to talk with the man who walked up on the street 
- This person is a consort of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] who wants out
	- His name is Escher
- There was another consort there that created the illusion, Ludvilla
	- Each consort has their own specialty, theirs is illusion 

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] and Yeska come down the stairs and see [[Effarig]] 
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] asks what is going on and what happened last night 
- [[Effarig]] says he doesn't know what is really going on
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] asks if [[Effarig]] still feels his god 
	- Answering yes, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks what more could one need
- After providing some more support he hands over two potions of healing 
	- We could really use them 

[[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] go back in to the church and [[Aeceran]] sits down
- [[Revach]] goes over next to [[Aeceran]] telling him you are who you are
	- He assures [[Aeceran]] he won't do what [[Effarig]] did
- [[Aeceran]] asserts that he did not bite [[Effarig]] 
- He begins telling [[Revach]] what he was telling [[Lionel]] 
	- Ludvilla created the illusions we were fighting 
	- The man in the street was Escher, the 4th consort 
	- Escher wants out and could possibly be an ally
		- He gave [[Aeceran]] some good information
	- He brought a message from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] goes over to [[Aeceran]] and assures him [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Effarig]] will come around 
- [[Aeceran]] says he is not a spawn and cannot be controlled by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 

The party stays frozen where they are for a while letting the tension sit 
- [[Aeceran]] spends some time juggling before quietly playing his flute
- [[Effarig]] sits at the front of the church praying
	- He hears nothing from his god but remembers what [[Church of Kelemvor#Kelemvor]] told him when they met 
- [[Effarig]] realized that [[Aeceran]] is an ally and not the top priority at the moment 

[[Effarig]] makes his way back to the others and everyone gets up, ready for a fight 
- He apologizes to [[Aeceran]] who says they they are even now
- [[Aeceran]] wants to get everything straight with the party and not have to explain things to everyone individually
	- During the fight he was teleported away by a consort of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], Escher 
	- He is the most recent consort and had a request to help them get away from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
		- He seemed honest about his intentions
		- Escher was also the person who invited us to meet with [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
	- An old suiter, Petrovia had an old note about a dowry that brings endless life and revive undead
		- He wants us to collect this 
		- He knows [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has this as well as knowing where [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] got his power
	- Escher cannot get it himself since he can only get where he is invited 
	- He also brought a message directly from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
		- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says that someone in the party cannot be trusted
			- Figured that out pretty quick, probably [[Effarig]] 
			- He has been keeping a close eye on us this whole time
	- Ludvilla Vilisevic is another consort who made the illusion 
	- Eschers specialty is storytelling, so was [[Aeceran]]'s
	- [[Aeceran]] assures everyone that he is not a spawn and cannot be controlled by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
		- He was kept in [[Castle Ravenloft]] for years before he was let out 
		- [[Aeceran]] was to meet with the [[Vistani]] and collect their stories
			- [[Madam Eva]] gave him some information and it seemed like the best path to choose
			- That led him to get us in [[Phandalin]] 

We begin to put things together and realize that we need to raid the [[Wachterhaus (Location)|Wachterhaus]] 
- This will be really hard but it can be done

## In Too Deep
We decide to head to the [[Wachterhaus (Location)|Wachterhaus]] to scope things out before we do a full raid 
- Sneaking around there are three entrances, front, back/servants, and a cellar
- Trying to get in the servants entrance and the cellar are both locked
- [[Lionel]] smells around near the doors
	- At the back he smells the roses in the garden and the servants 
	- At the cellar is a smell of sulfur and salt 
- [[Lionel]] tries to pick the cellar door and the mechanism clamps shut on the picks
	- [[Revach]] has to pull them out 
	- Using a mage hand, [[Aeceran]] has it stick its pinky in the lock, getting it snapped down on
- Trying again, [[Lionel]] is able to pick the lock open
	- As soon as it opens it starts smoldering and gets extremely hot 
	- [[Aeceran]] quickly snaps it shut again around one of the doors and it cools down
- Everyone but [[Effarig]] descends into the cellar to look around 
	- It is unfinished with a dirt floor and a mound of dirt at one side 
	- There is a worn path leading to a wall, a few cots, and a distinct smell of sulfur 
- Outside, [[Effarig]] hears people coming out the servants entrance and quickly goes into the cellar, closing the doors 
- As soon as we set foot on the dirt floor, skeletons pop out of the ground 
	- With [[Revach]] being a beast they are quickly taken out, nobody suffering a scratch
- Following the worn path there is clearly a secret door here
	- [[Aeceran]] feels around the wall and finds a catch to open it
	- Inside are 3 men and a woman dressed in robes, sitting in chairs at points of a pentagram
	- A woman yells out something against us but it didn't seem to come from the one in the room 

Quickly taking out the acolytes we start to look around and try to find the fifth person 
- [[Aeceran]] tries to magically light them up but with no results
- Around the pentagram are scattered electrum pieces
- Looking around for another secret door, [[Aeceran]] finds nothing but does realize that this room is sound proof
- [[Lionel]] begins to dig through what the acolytes had on them 
	- Most notable are a deep speech lexicon, woodcarvers knife and beech wood, and a blue baby's bow
	- The book is titled, "Scholarship on the Below"

With the mound of dirt in the cellar we decide to bury and hide the bodies
- We are able to quite nicely hide them and the skeleton bones

[[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] proceed up the set of stairs across the room
- At the top is a blank wall which [[Lionel]] smells leather through 
- Opening this panel reveals a servant's closet full of clothing and boots
- They step into the closet and consider what to do next
