##  The Gang is Broke
The party decides to leave the [[Blue Water Inn]] and do some looking around while [[Lionel]] stays to work on his project
- Most businesses are open until sunset
- They quickly hit the [[Dusklight Supply Shop]] to take care of some general goods needs
	- The woman there is very nice but her mind seemed to be on other things
- Coming to the edge of the town to the East find another shop
	- [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] 
	- The party enters and finds the owner who is immediately clocked as not being fully Barovian 
		- She has very slightly tipped ears and darker skin
	- We ask for some healing potions but she says they are in high demand
		- She recently ran out of ingredients
		- There is a shortage of Lifeleaf
		- If we return with some Lifeleaf and Druid's Rosemary we will get a discount on healing pots 
	- Asking why she is all the way out here she says she is no longer welcome in the town square
	- [[Aeceran]] asks how many of her people are still alive
		- She says there is a small faction outside with a [[Vistani]] camp
		- The [[Vistani]] are welcoming to most who are similarly outcast
	- Asking if she will trade in gold she says she will but it isn't common here
		- The pieces are missing the iconography of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
	- We tell her we will be back with reagents to buy some potions 

After finding that potions are outside our price range we decide to do some more looking 
[[Aeceran]] keeps an eye out for the guards in the town
- Checking who is with the Wachterhaus or [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] 
- Those employed by [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]] are in blue and the Wachterhaus wear the symbol of a red rose

Decide to go looking for some better equiptment
- Find that there is no shop for armor but there is one for weapons
	- [[Thimdul's Armaments]]
- Entering we see many weapons on the walls just collecting dust 
- There is a human sporting a long beard that is braided in a dwarven style
	- He has one working eye and one that is milky white
- The man introduces himself as [[Thimdul]] 
- He pokes at the parties choice of weapons and their make
	- He says that fancy things are made and worked on by a man outside of town in the [[Vistani]] camp
	- The man works out of his home and his craft is good 
- Trying to get some information out of him, [[Aeceran]] uses his magic to try and make him a little sleepy
	- The man accuses us of being of "his" persuasion implying that we work for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
	- We ask how he could think this and he informs us that is where magic comes from here
- [[Thimdul]] sees [[Revach]]'s hammer and asks to take a look, holding out his hands
	- [[Revach]] is hesitant but hands it over
	- [[Thimdul]] feels over the weapon with his hands like he is reading braille before holding it up to his ear 
	- He says the weapon can be improved and he can make it feel lighter or do piercing damage
		- He also had oils that would have a similar but short lived effect for 200 ep each
- Curious about what he could do for his whips, [[Aeceran]] hands them over
	- He could add something to the tip to make it more dangerous or hold poisons
	- [[Thimdul]] would need to hold on to it for 3 days and it would cost 250 ep
- Asking about an old, dusty set of studded leather he says it is 90 ep but all prices can be lessened if he is impressed
	- We inquire further and find that [[Thimdul]] wants a man called [[Izek Stronski|Izek]] Stronski taken care of
	- It would result in a big discount 
	- He is [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]], [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s strongman who has taken many weapons from [[Thimdul]] for [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]]
	- If we were caught doing this we would be in some hot water 
	- [[Thimdul]] is clearly afraid of [[Izek Stronski|Izek]] when he speaks about him 
	- Asking further he says [[Izek Stronski|Izek]] came to [[Vallaki]] as a boy 20 years ago and he is different
		- He doesn't specify how just that we will know when we see him 
- [[Aeceran]] asks his feeling on [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]] and the Wachterhaus 
	- [[Thimdul]] says he has no love for the Wachterhaus but at least they deal in coin 
	- There is a clear venom in his words when he speaks about [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]] 
- He thanks us for wasting his time and we leave with a little more information about the town
