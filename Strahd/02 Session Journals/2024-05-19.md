oneLiner: The party explores Vallaki meeting new people and learns about a church secret
---
##  The Gang is Broke
The party decides to leave the [[Blue Water Inn]] and do some looking around while [[Lionel]] stays to work on his project
- Most businesses are open until sunset
- They quickly hit the [[Dusklight Supply Shop]] to take care of some general goods needs
	- The woman there is very nice but her mind seemed to be on other things
- Coming to the edge of the town to the East find another shop
	- [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] 
	- The party enters and finds the owner who is immediately clocked as not being fully Barovian 
		- She has very slightly tipped ears and darker skin
	- We ask for some healing potions but she says they are in high demand
		- She recently ran out of ingredients
		- There is a shortage of Lifeleaf
		- If we return with some Lifeleaf and Druid's Rosemary we will get a discount on healing pots 
	- Asking why she is all the way out here she says she is no longer welcome in the town square
	- [[Aeceran]] asks how many of her people are still alive
		- She says there is a small faction outside with a [[Vistani]] camp
		- The [[Vistani]] are welcoming to most who are similarly outcast
	- Asking if she will trade in gold she says she will but it isn't common here
		- The pieces are missing the iconography of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
	- We tell her we will be back with reagents to buy some potions 

After finding that potions are outside our price range we decide to do some more looking 
[[Aeceran]] keeps an eye out for the guards in the town
- Checking who is with the Wachterhaus or [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] 
- Those employed by [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]] are in blue and the Wachterhaus wear the symbol of a red rose

Decide to go looking for some better equiptment
- Find that there is no shop for armor but there is one for weapons
	- [[Thimdul's Armaments]]
- Entering we see many weapons on the walls just collecting dust 
- There is a human sporting a long beard that is braided in a dwarven style
	- He has one working eye and one that is milky white
- The man introduces himself as [[Thimdul]] 
- He pokes at the parties choice of weapons and their make
	- He says that fancy things are made and worked on by a man outside of town in the [[Vistani]] camp
	- The man works out of his home and his craft is good 
- Trying to get some information out of him, [[Aeceran]] uses his magic to try and make him a little sleepy
	- The man accuses us of being of "his" persuasion implying that we work for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
	- We ask how he could think this and he informs us that is where magic comes from here
- [[Thimdul]] sees [[Revach]]'s hammer and asks to take a look, holding out his hands
	- [[Revach]] is hesitant but hands it over
	- [[Thimdul]] feels over the weapon with his hands like he is reading braille before holding it up to his ear 
	- He says the weapon can be improved and he can make it feel lighter or do piercing damage
		- He also had oils that would have a similar but short lived effect for 200 ep each
- Curious about what he could do for his whips, [[Aeceran]] hands them over
	- He could add something to the tip to make it more dangerous or hold poisons
	- [[Thimdul]] would need to hold on to it for 3 days and it would cost 250 ep
- Asking about an old, dusty set of studded leather he says it is 90 ep but all prices can be lessened if he is impressed
	- We inquire further and find that [[Thimdul]] wants a man called [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] Stronski taken care of
	- It would result in a big discount 
	- He is [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]], [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s strongman who has taken many weapons from [[Thimdul]] for [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]]
	- If we were caught doing this we would be in some hot water 
	- [[Thimdul]] is clearly afraid of [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] when he speaks about him 
	- Asking further he says [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] came to [[Vallaki]] as a boy 20 years ago and he is different
		- He doesn't specify how just that we will know when we see him 
- [[Aeceran]] asks his feeling on [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]] and the Wachterhaus 
	- [[Thimdul]] says he has no love for the Wachterhaus but at least they deal in coin 
	- There is a clear venom in his words when he speaks about [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]] 
- He thanks us for wasting his time and we leave with a little more information about the town

Going back across town toward the [[Blue Water Inn]] we see many people
- Many are headed West toward the church 
- There are children in the street, some with genuine joy on their faces

## A Performance and Stolen Goods 
Getting back to the inn, [[Aeceran]] beings to warm up for his performance 
- He is going to play to help pay for the rooms we were given while [[Lionel]] joins the others to the church 
- [[Aeceran]]'s viol is a rich mahogany color with a yellow, red, and orange star along the bridge

The others all set off for the local church, the Church of St. Andral
- The building is large and the limestone it is made of is eaten away and slouching
- There are cracked stained windows all around the building 
- Many people have made their way inside and are huddled together in groups
- A man in robes and a young boy are handing out blankets and food
	- The people in the pews are settling down and getting ready to sleep
	- We hear whispers of adventurers, outsiders, and elves
- The second floor overhangs the ground and contains fewer people 

[[Effarig]] heads to talk with the man in robes 
- He introduces himself as [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]
- Asking about the building itself [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says it is from the original civilization
	- He shows a slight hesitation when he says it is the safest place in the city
- Asking about the story of St. Andral he goes into a story 
	- The town was set upon by evil and the towns faithful were trapped in the church 
	- They were trapped for days and eventually their supplies ran out 
	- A priest, St. Andruil offered himself to the congregation to sustain them 
	- His body continued to provide until the threat was gone
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says if [[Effarig]] wants more stories he can meet him in his office when he is done
	- Asking what can be done he says [[Lionel]] can help the boy hand things out and [[Revach]] can help another out in the graveyard
		- The boy who is supposed to lock up the crypt is taking longer than expected
		- [[Lionel]] can have a tour if he helps out the boy
		- [[Effarig]] can meet with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] to talk some 
- [[Lionel]] goes with the boy who is 10 or 11 named Yeska
	- They help hand things out on the second floor 
	- Yeska is excited and rapid fires off questions before [[Lionel]] has a chance to respond to any of them 

We jump to [[Aeceran]] in the [[Blue Water Inn]] doing his performance 
- The music brings in many people who are taken aback
- There is now standing room only with so many people 
- In the middle of all this [[Aeceran]] notices the orator, Richtavio make his way out of the inn 

[[Effarig]] accompanies [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] to the second floor where there is a smaller chapel
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] crosses to look out a window and slumps down, seeming defeated
- He asks where [[Effarig]] stands and what his goals are to which he responds to purge the land of undead
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says they still have the bones of St. Andral and it is what keeps this place safe 
	- They only have one bone, the skull
	- It has recently been stolen and removed from the church 
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] believes that the gravedigger, Milivoj, is the one who took it
	- If he started asking around people would get suspicious
	- Milivoj has a bit of a temper and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] doesn't know how he will react 
		- The priest can't accuse him since he doesn't want to break that trust
- [[Effarig]] says he will look around and try to find the skull  
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks [[Effarig]] that if he find the skull and it is still in its bag, don't look at it

[[Revach]] heads to the back of the church to look for Milivoj 
- He finds a teenage boy with a shovel over his shoulder
- He has his head on a swivel, looking for something 
- Aparently he has just been doing his rounds and asks [[Revach]] to join him 
- They walk around the graveyard and Milivoj seems to be looking around, expecting something 
	- He tells [[Revach]] that he just has a bad feeling 
- In the middle of the graveyard is a worn statue of St. Andral 

[[Effarig]] talks more with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucien]]
- Ask if he knows [[Gregori Donavich|Father Gregori]] 
	- He does and says most priests come from here or the abbey from the West 
	- He had heard something about his son joining with a mage to destroy [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
- Ask if he has heard about the church just outside town ([[2024-05-05#The Abandoned Church]])
	- He does not but is not surprised
	- [[Vallaki]] used to stretch for miles and there were churches every so often
	- He could send hunters to check it out 
- Are there any other bones of St. Andral?
	- He has only ever had the skull with the others scattered or taken  
	- He asks [[Effarig]] to not look at the skull if he finds it
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] gives [[Effarig]] the key to the crypt under the church 

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] leaves needing to start the nights service
- [[Lionel]] is showing Yeska his sword and the boy is ecstatic 
	- Talking with him we find out Milivoj was locked up before for speaking against [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
	- Yeska wants to help Milivoj 
- [[Effarig]] sees a mischevious glint in [[Lionel]]'s eye 
	- They meet with [[Revach]] and go to check out the crypt before they end their night 

They go down into the crypt with Yeska 
- The floor is metal and there is lots of dust 
- Yeska says one wing is important people and the other are those less important like those who built the church 
- The lids of the coffins in the important wing are metal with a small overhang 
	- They are hinged and columns behind them look like they can be used to open them, it is geared
- Going to the tomb of St. Andral, it is made of stone 
	- It is really well made and has no mechanical components 
	- [[Lionel]] looks at it and finds a tiny scratch in a triangular shape
	- Most likely from something wedged in there 
- We ask Yeska if he knows anything
	- He breaks pretty easily and says that Milivoj was angry and worried about his little sister who was sick
	- Yeska told Milivoj about the skull so it was most likely him 
	- We promise we won't tell [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about it and he won't get in trouble
- We go back upstairs

Back to [[Aeceran]], he has finished his set and is relaxing
- A man comes over and says the set was impressive
- He wants to know if we will go see [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] tomorrow
- She is free in the afternoon and we want some time in the morning so we are invited for lunch
- The man introduces himself as Ernst Larnak and [[Aeceran]] introduces himself as Lalan
- Ernst says we will likely get a request to meet [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] at the same time
	- He likes to schedule over [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
- He leaves and [[Aeceran]] realizes there is probably a connection to Richtavio leaving

The others are still at the church and see Milivoj at a pew
- They realize that he could easily get information out of Yeska 
- [[Lionel]] gives Yeska his quarterstaff and says he will teach him to use it if he doesn't say anything to Milivoj 

They decide to go back to the [[Blue Water Inn]] and fill in [[Aeceran]] 

## Interrogation and Devilish Influence
[[Aeceran]] has finished his set and it sitting at the bar with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] 
- He is occasionally using prestidigitation to help clean 
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] seems more calm than she has been 
- There has obviously been a large number of people here recently 
- [[Aeceran]] says we have a lunch invite and the other tell him what happened at the church 
- We want his talking skills since the rest of us aren't great at that

Quick long rest and some temp hp because we slept so well

We head back over to [[St. Andral's Church]] to interrogate Milivoj 
- He is in a corner, twiddling his thumbs and leaning on his shovel
- [[Effarig]] notices a woman in the same position she was last night 
- Start talking with Milivoj and ask about him 
	- Says he tried to keep his younger brother and sister in good health
	- His sister was sick and someone from the congregation gave him some herbs and she is getting better 
	- [[Aeceran]] charms him and tells him to tell us everything he knows about the skull 
- **The skull is weird and has some sharp teeth**
- Henrik in town paid him a good amount for the skull 
	- He is the coffin maker
	- He can tell us where the skull is
	- He is not a follower of Lathander

Satisfied with their next lead the party decides to head back to the [[Blue Water Inn]] for a bit 
- On their way there they see a hulking man walking toward them 
- He gets closer and we see a red, scaly arm rested on his sword 
- He says we will go with him to see [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] immediately 
	- We say we have lunch plans and will be late if we did that 
	- The man assures us we won't be late and we agree to go with him
