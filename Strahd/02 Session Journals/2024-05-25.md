oneLiner: The Baron has a meeting with the party and a new threat is found within the walls of Vallaki
---
## [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
The party is following [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] after being instructed to follow and meet [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
[[Lionel]] is concerned that our outfits are not nice enough to meet [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
- We make a quick stop at the [[Blue Water Inn]] to change and pick up [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
- [[Effarig]] notices that [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] is staring at [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
	- It is for sure a stare of wanting

We leave and continue to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s mansion
-  The entryway filled with pictures of people that look very much alike
- Down the hall toward the dining room are bundles of sticks on the floor
- We pass a door from which we hear giggling
- Going through a door across from that we enter a dining room
	- There is a long table filled with breakfast foods
	- At the head is [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] flanked on either side by two large mastiffs

[[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] introduces himself and we all do in turn
- At this point everyone notices how [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] is looking at [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is clearly uncomfortable
	- [[Aeceran]] leans over to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to assure her that he will help if [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] wants any

We all eat and [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] begins to speak with us
- He asks about our travels and we are honest with him 
	- Say it was pretty quiet and the most we encountered were the treeants 
	- He proposes that maybe the happiness in [[Vallaki]] is spreading outside the walls 
- He has a proposition for us
	- Asking about the festivals we tell him we had heard about the wolf's head jamboree
	- There is going to be another festival in two days and he wants us to speak 
	- Tell the people that it is much safer in [[Vallaki]] than it is other places in [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] 
- Things fall silent while we all look at each other thinking about it
	- We hear through the walls plates clinking and another conversation wrap up
	- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] excuses himself to speak with his wife

We all begin to quietly discuss what we think
- He must trust us if he just leaves us in the room by ourselves
- [[Effarig]] doesn't want to say anything that he doesn't believe
- [[Lionel]] thinks [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] doesn't really care about us and just wants to use us

[[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] enters again with his wife Lydia
- She seems very discombobulated and smiling a little too hard
- It is common for nobility like this to introduce their spouse and heir but we have not seen [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s son 
- Lydia talks some about what [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] has done for the city
	- He paid for B.O.M. to open

Back to what [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] proposed, [[Lionel]] asks if the people would even care if we said anything 
- He says since we are traveled and can talk about different places we will be believed
- We are assured of the safety of [[Vallaki]] with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] directly saying "[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]" and not "[[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]]" or something else
	- He has no permission to enter the city and its walls and hasn't been seen in [[Vallaki]] for a decade
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] wants [[Effarig]] to speak since he looks most like the people in the city
	- After some hemming and hawing we agree and [[Aeceran]] will write the script for [[Effarig]] 

[[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] says he has another delicate matter to discuss 
- His wife leaves the room
- He wants us to report back to him tomorrow after we meet with [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]
- We sort of agree to do this although similarly begrudgingly

We finish up out breakfast and leave 
- Trying to stick with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and make her feel safer after being stared at
- On our way to [[Blue Water Inn]] we see a man being carried to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s manor 
	- He is a barely conscious middle aged man in nicer clothing
	- He is very beaten and in cuffs

## The Coffin Maker
Drop [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] at the Inn 
- We have some time before we meet with [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
- Decide to go looking for the skull with the coffin maker, Henrik van der Voort

Head to the stockyard and easily find his shop
- On the front door is a closed sign but we can hear a mallet from inside
- Knocking and calling in the hammering stop before eventually starting again 
- Knocking again a man calls out and we say we want to talk with him 
	- He says to come back when the shop is open

Not wanting to wait we take a look around the store for another way in
- There is another entrance in the back that is locked
- [[Lionel]] manages to pick it open and we start to go into a room full of coffins
	- Only some make it in before Henrik comes around a corner to see what was making noise
	- After a scuffle Henrik is knocked out by [[Aeceran]] and tied up
- Waiting for Henrik to come to, [[Lionel]] runs upstairs to look for the skull 
	- On the second floor looking in he sees some [[vampires]] and is attacked by a swarm of rats

Seeing how dire the situation is, [[Lionel]] transforms into his thrope form
- Everyone runs up the stairs to help
- The [[vampires]] regenerate some of their health after every turn
- [[Effarig]] uses the [[Magic Mister]] with holy water and the [[Light Gem]] to make them stop regenerating
- We hear Henrik fall and start squirming on the floor during the fight
- [[Effarig]] takes significant damage and falls unconscious during the fight 
	- Similar to the other times he has gone down he hears a voice
	- This time it is a feminine voice that is struck by how [[Effarig]] is different 
	- Says he is not quite desperate enough yet
	- The voice is clearly insane and reminds him of patients he has worked with before 
	- It was clearly a very powerful being
- After some time [[Revach]] strikes the last blow and they are all taken care of
- [[Effarig]] is stabilized and things wind down

Those that are conscious start looking around again for the skull or clues
- They find a room with 5 crates of dirt, 30 sp with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s mom's face on them, 12 ep, and the skull 
	- The skull has obvious long incisors 
- Looking over Henrik they find a piece of paper in his pocket
	- It has been crumpled and flattened before
