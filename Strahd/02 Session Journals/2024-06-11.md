## Blinsky's Toys
Back at the [[Blue Water Inn]] after a long day even though it is early afternoon
- We are able to put together some of the reading [[Madam Eva]] gave us
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] is most definitely The Traitor ([[2024-04-20#The Reading]])

Wanting to wind down but continue our investigation of the town we decide to check out Blinsky's Toys
- When we enter the street we notice that the air feels colder and it feels like we are being watched
	- Thinking back it has been like this since we found the [[Vampires]] 
- In the square we see a banner reading, "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky"
- Opening the door starts a rube goldberg machine that starts up some music
- There is a man at the counter with a jesters hat on with rusted bells
	- He has a monkey on one shoulder
- We begin talking and Blinsky tries asking us if we would like to buy anything
- [[Lionel]] asks how long he has been in [[Vallaki]] and what his specialty is
	- He has been there for a long time
	- He will make anything but he likes making dolls and animals 
- There was a special order for dolls and he pulls out multiple saying they were iterations
	- All of them get closer and closer to an exact likeness of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
	- We ask who ordered this and he says he shouldn't say 
		- Perhaps if we wanted to buy this person something but he won't say who
	- The doll is the image of a muse of his
- We notice that most of the toys there are covered in dust
	- He hasn't sold much recently
	- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] keeps him in business, buying things for his festivals

We show him the carousel from [[The Windmill]] 
- He says he makes them to play music and shows a different model he made 
- We ask if he remembers who ordered it and he says a nice old couple
	- They offered to pay him with sweets
	- The pie they gave him he could never forget
	- When asked if it was similar to those from the bakery he says he hasn't gone there yet

Blinsky has something to ask of us
- He knows most visitors are not friendly with [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 
- There is a creation in [[Castle Ravenloft]], a mechanical man 
- It can presumably walk, talk, and converse
- He wants plans to make it or the thing itself so he can make one 

We ask about his monkey and Blinsky introduces Piccolo
- The orator from the [[Blue Water Inn]], Richtavio gave it to him
- [[Lionel]] tries to smell the monkey to see if it is real
	- Seems like it is real but he also picks up a very faint hint of cologne

[[Lionel]] wants to get [[Brae Martikov|Brae]] something 
- Blinsky doesn't have any ravens but he pulls down a hawk and goes in the back of the store 
- Some time later he returns having carved it into a raven 

We start heading back to the [[Blue Water Inn]] 

## Safety In Numbers
In the streets things seem off 
- There are a lot fewer people than before and those that are around are huddled in groups
- It feels like it is even colder than before 
- From some of the groups we hear whispered mentions of [[Vampires]] 
	- Curious, [[Aeceran]] goes up to a clique to ask what is going on
	- They say there are rumors about [[Vampires]] in the town
	- There is a long chain of where this comes from that doesn't make any sense

We decide to go to [[St. Andral's Church]] to speak with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] 
- When we reach it [[Aeceran]] enters and feel sluggish with a bad headache
- [[Effarig]] notices the church now feels noticeably holy
- The church is packed with people, the night's rush coming in early 
	- A man and a woman are in the same spot we have seen them before, praying
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] are there helping out and in full armor
- [[Effarig]] notices that [[Aeceran]] is not as graceful as he normally is
- We go to talk with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
	- They heard rumors and heard people were going to the church so they came
	- We will tell them what happened during the day later in [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s office

With how odd things are we decide it would be best to stay at [[St. Andral's Church|St. Andral's]] for the night
- We make a trip to [[Blue Water Inn]] to get what we need for the night 
- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] ask what is going on
	- We say things just feel off and we will be staying at the church for safety 
	- They offer for us to stay in their saferoom if we want 

We grab our things and start heading back to [[St. Andral's Church|St. Andral's]] 
- On the way we see people heading towards the Wachterhaus
- Going to check it out we see people with torches and pitchforks in the back yard
- [[Aeceran]] tries to sneak around and see what is going on
	- He gets seen and a man calls us all out
	- The man accuses us of brining in the evil since we are outsiders
	- We say we were with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] today and begin to discuss what is going on
- After some time [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] comes out of her back door
	- She has armed as many people as she can 
	- There is danger here and people should stay together 
	- This appeases the mob and they begin to scatter 

We make it back to [[St. Andral's Church|St. Andral's]] and head up to talk with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] 
- Opening his office he is tired and weary, surrounded by bottles
	- He has been trying to make as much holy water as possible
- We tell him we will be staying the night and he seems a bit more at ease 
- It is safer here now that the bones are where they should be
- [[Aeceran]] asks if [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] has touched the skull
	- He has but it did not cause him to go unconscious like [[Aeceran]] did earlier
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says he should send a note to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] about bringing in the people in the stocks before he leaves

The party settles in for the night 
- [[Lionel]] works on being able to replicate the mister
- [[Effarig]] tries to help out [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] and makes some holy water
- [[Revach]] wants to go back to the [[Blue Water Inn]] and [[Aeceran]] accompanies him
	- On the way [[Revach]] asks [[Aeceran]] where he got his viol
	- He had noticed the star symbol on it and they talk about their connection to that god 
		- [[Aeceran]] divulges more than [[Aeceran]] 

At the inn, [[Revach]] asks [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] about some evil with [[Aeceran]] in the other room
- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] knows what [[Revach]] is talking about but won't tell him
- He could if [[Revach]] does something for him 
	- There is a winery to the west across the second bridge past the tower, go there and do... something
	- If he sees an old man, tell him [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] misses him

[[Revach]] and [[Aeceran]] head back to the church for the night 
[[Lionel]] noticed the couple that hasn't moved and has kept praying 
- [[Effarig]] noticed it too and thinks we maybe should talk with them at some point

We settle in and take watches for the night 
- During his watch, [[Revach]] sees the door crack slightly before there is the sound of steam and someone hissing
- He wakes us all up and [[Aeceran]] goes to look out the window
	- He sees a red light in the building across the street and decided to go out to take a look
- [[Effarig]] and [[Aeceran]] leave the building and begin to cross the street  
	- They are stopped by a well dressed man walking down the road 
	- [[Effarig]] uses the Lady's Veil and the man does not light up as undead although something across the street does 
	- The man says he is the son of the baron of Krezk 
		- He has an important message for [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] 
- Realizing how weird this is and knowing there is something across the street, [[Aeceran]] tells him to come with us across the street 
	- We begin to cross as the man, behind [[Aeceran]] puts a hand on his shoulder and [[Aeceran]] is yanked away but his body is still there 
	- [[Effarig]] feels the [[Gold & Silver Ring]] tug as 3 sets of red eyes appear across the street
