oneLiner: The raid of the Wachterhaus continues but we are found out before discovering Lady Wachter's secrets
---
## The Heist
[[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] are in the servant's closet together
- [[Lionel]] listens through the door and hears some faint whispers
	- "Who knows what she'll do if we give it away"
- [[Aeceran]] peeks out of the closet and sees a small servant's entryway
- They decide to go to the right, away from the hushed voices
	- This room is a storage area with food supplies
	- They specifically notice Red Dragon Crush wine
- Going to the next door down, [[Lionel]] listens and hears nothing, smelling a fire
	- This room has a stovetop, fireplace, and small pantry

[[Effarig]] and [[Revach]] are still down in the cellar, keeping an eye out
- The sound proofed room is very eerie

Through the next door, [[Lionel]] and [[Aeceran]] find themselves in the entryway
- We were led through here to get to the dining room
- Next to them is a set of stairs
- They head up the stairs and into a hallway lined with a few doors
- There are paintings of [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] on the walls
- They decide to go to the room to their right where [[Lionel]] picks the lock
	- It is a bedroom for one person and there is nothing specifically of note 
	- There are many bottles on the floor next to the bed 
	- The room is clearly used quite often
	- The closet has hunting equipment and looks like something the wealthy man we saw in [[Blue Water Inn]] would wear ([[2024-05-11]])
	- They don't find much and decide to move on

In the cellar, [[Revach]] and [[Effarig]] hear a rattling from the cellar door 
- With nowhere else to go they try to follow [[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] 
- They head to the first floor and into the entryway 
- Behind them they hear people come in and say to search everything from top to bottom

[[Aeceran]] quietly moves down the hallway and notices the slippery feeling of the rest of the house goes away near a door 
- [[Lionel]] smells at the door and notices a slight odor of decay
- While they are looking they notice repetitive pacing from another room
- [[Lionel]] picks the lock and takes a look in
	- There is a small hearth with a portrait above of [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]], her husband, two sons, and daughter
	- On the bed is a man in all black with two electrum on his eyes
		- He looks like the father in the portrait 

Back in the entryway the other two continue to hear voices from the cellar 
- "Mother said there should have been a book club down there"
- [[Effarig]] and [[Revach]] move away from the voices and try to find a way out of the house 
- At the front door with nowhere else to go we head up the stairs 

[[Aeceran]] goes over to a wardrobe in the room he is drawn to
- It is open and [[Lionel]] tries to pick it open
	- He is pricked and poisoned by a needle coming out from the lock
- Now at the top of the stairs, [[Aeceran]] hears [[Effarig]] and [[Revach]], rushing them into the room with the dead man
	- [[Aeceran]] looks over the body and feels that he is very frail, dead for a long time
- [[Effarig]] goes over to the wardrobe and tries to wrench it open
	- With a snap and a creak from the hinges it comes open
	- Inside is a large portrait of the [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s wedding, officiated by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
	- At the bottom is a large chest that is locked but [[Lionel]] is able to open it
		- Inside is an incredible presence that is evil and holy
		- There is a large tome sitting on top of a pile of bones that are presumably St. Andral's 

As we are looking through the wardrobe we hear behind us [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] say it is rude to snoop through someone's home

## We're Made!
[[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] summons two demons to fight but she is nearly knocked out
- Before we can take care of her, her sons rush up from the cellar with some acolytes
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and one of her sons is knocked unconscious
- At the end of the fight, [[Effarig]] runs through the other son, throwing him down the stairs 

Someone realizes that the body of the husband is being kept nice by a constant casting of gentle repost
We search the bodies for anything useful
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has three keys, two for what we already opened and a silver one 
	- She also has lots of fine jewelry on her which we do not take 
	- There is also a book for translating celestial
- One of the sons has a thick poison on him which we take 

Looking at the book in the chest, as soon as it is picked up, a holy wave starts to emanate from the bones 
- The writing inside is very calligraphic and pretty
- There are multiple languages in it and we can only understand some of it
	- Infernal, Deep Speech, Primordial, Celestial, and Draconic
	- Looking at what we can read, it is most definitely written by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 

Using the time we have we head to check out the other rooms
- The other son's room is similar to the other just without the bottles 
	- There is nothing interesting we find there 
- We go to another room where [[Aeceran]] and [[Lionel]] heard cats
	- Going inside it seems like a library but there are barely any books on the shelves
	- The cats hiss and are upset we are in this room 
	- [[Aeceran]] quickly looks through some of the books there
		- "Golden Legend" and "The Beast's Winter" have been read through many times 
	- [[Aeceran]] tries to feed one of the cats before it hisses and begins to grow
		- All the cats grow into scaly beasts with long tails
		- One of the cats turns into a large black cat with three tails 

After fighting off the scaly cats and injuring the black, it shrinks back down and runs off under a bookshelf
- Looking at the shelf it clearly opens to a secret room 
- Going inside, it is very dusty and there is a silver chest inside 
- We open it with the silver key and it has a few items in it
	- "The Devil We Know" by [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona Wachter]] 
	- A tome bound in black leather, "Grimoire of the Four Quarters"
		- [[Effarig]] knows this is written by a diabolist named Devostas who was drawn and quartered for a month before he disappeared and wrote this book on how he did it
		- This is the book Escher wanted us to find about immortality
		- There is only one copy and anyone who reads it goes insane
	- A book on language translation that we have found before 
	- Scrolls that are deeds of ownership
		- The Wachterhaus, the farm next to it, a large home in the [[Village of Barovia]], and a home in Berez

We go to the last unopened door that the pacing is coming from
- Trying all the keys none of them work, the lock is broken and will not open 
- [[Aeceran]] begins talking through the door with no response and the pacing continues 
	- Thinking it may be Stella Wachter he mentions that Victor sent us to get her 
	- The pacing stops and she rushes to the door 
	- She seems out of it saying her kitties don't like us and how the cats and kitties are different
- [[Aeceran]] mends the lock and says we will not enter without her permission
	- This frightens her making her thing [[Aeceran]] is a [[Vampires|Vampire]] 
	- After some reassurance she is convinced to open the door 
- A teenager in a tattered blue dress steps out
- [[Lionel]] notices there is probably something magical that made her insane 
	- Probably the Grimoire of the Four Quarters
