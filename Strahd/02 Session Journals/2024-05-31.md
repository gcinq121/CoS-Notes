## The Dash For Innocence
The party is in the coffin maker, Henrik's shop after defeating the [[Vampires]] 
- [[Effarig]] is still unconscious for a few hours
- The coffin maker himself is also unconscious 

The three that are awake go into the street with some bodies, Henrik, and [[Effarig]] 
- Trying to decide what to do
- People passing by look on in fear and some walk quickly away going to flag some guards
- They decide to go get a healing potion to wake up [[Effarig]] 
- [[Aeceran]] and [[Revach]] notice two black cats following them on the way there 
	- They remember two on top of the [[Blue Water Inn]] and one on top of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s manor 

They arrive at [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] and rush in
- The woman at the counter is shocked to see them 
- [[Aeceran]] pulls the blinds and says they need a potion for [[Effarig]] 
- She quickly gets a potion and [[Lionel]] pays before using it

[[Effarig]] comes out of his nap and is told to read the note in infernal
- It is for the [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s book club inviting the reader 
	- "come the 4th day after the new moon just after dusk"

Realizing we need to regroup we decide to head back to Henrik's shop
- Before we leave, [[Aeceran]] slings a [[Vampires|Vampire]] body over his shoulder and lifts the top lip slightly so the shopkeeper can see 
- Quickly making it through the streets they return to Henrik's shop 

To try and make up for what has happened already we put the bodies in coffins
- We barely get some in before there is a knock at the door
- [[Effarig]] answers the door seeing two town guards
- He speaks with them while the others are doing their best to cover some things up
- The guard is convinced that [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] would understand what happened 
	- He will take us to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
- [[Aeceran]] says we will also need [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] to prove we were on church business
	- The second guard goes off to get him 
- We gather up the bodies and begin heading to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s manor 
	- People look on but seem more at ease since we are with a guard 

At [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s manor we are led into the room across from where we had brunch
- It reeks of pipe smoke and a taxidermy bear head hangs on the wall
- [[Revach]] hears a faint rattle of chains from upstairs
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]], flanked by his dogs and followed by [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] enter and tell us to sit 
- We begin to explain why we were running through the streets with bodies
	- Before we say what exactly happened he orders [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] to inspect the bodies 
	- He sees the teeth on the body and is stunned, asking where we found these
	- He calls for another guard and one enters with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] 
		- He tells the guard to get smelling salts for Henrik 
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] confirms that we were on church business 
	- This has a lot of weight with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] and he takes his word
		- If it wasn't for this we would be prosecuted
- We say there were no more that we found in the shop 
	- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] sends guards to close up Henrik's shop 
	- He doesn't want to create a panic and he is starting an investigation
	- We will go to the [[Blue Water Inn]] and wait to speak with him before we go anywhere else

We leave as [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] stares out at us
- [[Effarig]] notices a black cat in the attic window of the manor 

## The Cover Story
We make it to the [[Blue Water Inn]] 
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] is surprised to see us so beat up
- [[Aeceran]] asks to speak with her and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] 
	- We head to the back so we can ask some questions
- We ask about the cats and if they know anything
	- They say most of them are just normal strays 
	- At least one of them is controlled by [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s son, [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]]
		- There is some bad blood there that got him kicked out
- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] asks what roughed us up
	- Before we do [[Aeceran]] asks about the chains we heard from upstairs 
		- Most likely the cobbler that was arrested
		- We realize that this was the man we saw earlier today being dragged to the manor 
	- [[Aeceran]] tells him we were investigating and had to fight servants of [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil]] 
		- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] jumps to his feet, at high alert
		- [[Aeceran]] asks what he knows about Henrik 
			- He seems totally normal and a nice person
	- The note in infernal is most likely [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
		- Henrik must have been planning something
		- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has people meet with her and later they begin devil worship
			- The "book club" is likely her cover 
- The doors open and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] comes in
	- He asks if we were successful in our mission
	- [[Aeceran]] pulls out the bag with the skull but before he hands it over he puts his hand it, threatening to pull it out
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] and [[Effarig]] protest trying to stop him 
	- Before he can be stopped, [[Aeceran]] touches the skull and immediately falls to the ground, hitting his head 
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] lunges and catches the skull and quickly leaves
- [[Aeceran]]'s heartbeat is irregular and quick 
	- It begins to calm after 30 seconds
	- He blinks awake feeling hungover with a terrible headache
	- He doesn't remember what happened 

Beaten and bruised waiting on [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]], the party rests for a while 

Some time later a guard comes and says [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] called for us
- He leads us back to the manor and into his den where the bodies are gone
- He says he investigated and found that bandits jumped Henrik 
	- They forced him to house them 
- We saved him after hearing something from [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] 
- Assuring him we agree on this official record we begin talking about what actually happened 
- He thinks this was all concocted by [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
	- She wants to show that [[Vallaki]] isn't really that safe
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] wants us during our meeting to find anything that would make her unpopular
	- If we are to make a disturbance he would have to prosecute us

We leave to go to the [[Blue Water Inn]] to get ready for our lunch
- [[Lionel]] gets changed into nicer clothes
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] left a note saying they are at [[St. Andral's Church]] 
	- They won't join us for the meeting 

## Meeting with [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
After getting into some nicer clothing we start toward [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s house 
- On the way a black cat makes its way over, seeming rushed
- It has a slip of paper in it's mouth which [[Lionel]] takes 
	- "Save [[Stella Wachter]]. Please. You're her only hope"
	- It nuzzles [[Aeceran]]'s hand and he feels that it is just bone
	- [[Aeceran]] returns the note to the cat to bring back to its master
	- We assume it is from [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s son, [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] 

Continuing on we make it to the mansion
- There is a gardener out front taking care of the flowers
- He introduces himself and asks if we need a pick-me-up
	- We look very tired, have had a long day
	- He offers [[Revach]] and [[Effarig]] a red potions 
	- We accept and see a woman with white hair in a window looking at us
- The gardener leads us to the front door and lets us in

The home is very opulent
- The front has red roses and the door is stained glass
- We are brought in to the left where we enter a dining room
	- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] is at the head of the table and staring at us
- The table is immaculately set 
- Across to the parlor are a few paintings
	- Two of the wealthy hunters we saw when we first entered the [[Blue Water Inn]] 
	- One of [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and another of a man 
	- A large portrait of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] 

We all sit down and [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] thanks us for meeting her there 
- She motions and several servants come out with fruits, veggies, and meats
- She introduces herself as [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona Wachter]] and we all do in turn
	- When [[Aeceran]] says he is Laylan she narrows her eyes but says nothing
- She asks for stories of our travels on the road or from our homeland
	- [[Lionel]] takes this as an opportunity to rant about his research for a moment

We noticed some things when we entered the home 
- As we are eating, [[Lionel]] smells a tinge of sulfur
- [[Aeceran]] notices that his drink feels slippery in his hand and everything here seems slippery 
- [[Effarig]] feels that the presence from the [[Gold & Silver Ring]] is gone

[[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] asks our thoughts on [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
- Do we think that the people here are happy?
- What about putting people in stocks? Have we heard their crime?
	- Malicious unhappiness
- Do we feel like we can say whatever we wanted in the streets?
- We really don't want to say much so she launches into her opinion
	- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] is a pestilence on the town
	- If his largest bludgeon, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] was taken out, people would see reason
- [[Aeceran]] asks what her vision is for [[Vallaki]] 
	- She wants people to be free to vote
	- Generational and Familial ties are not enough to keep people in power
- She helps people and doesn't **directly** ask for anything 
	- She is aware of the influences she has 
	- Free stuff comes with loyalty

[[Aeceran]] asks about the portraits
- Her sons, Nikolai and Karl, herself, and her late husband, Nikolai 

Wrapping things up she recommends The Beast's Rose, her tailor

For some reason I didn't really note tone and how things ended up in my notes 
- The party generally speaks their mind
	- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] says we couldn't do that if we were with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] 
- We agree that someone democratically elected would be better
	- Sometimes you need a heavy hand though, especially in tough, scary times 
- The party generally shows dislike toward [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] 
	- She seemed to think we would be more on her side 
	- If we come around she would be happy to talk with us more
That is pretty much it, no hate but just some distrust

We finish up and leave 
- As [[Aeceran]] walks out he feels himself slipping on the floor
- [[Effarig]] feels a pull from the [[Gold & Silver Ring]] as soon as he leaves 
	- There was something off about the house
	- There is no good or evil in the house at all, it is completely neutral
	- It feels scrubbed clean 

We walk back to the [[Blue Water Inn]] 
- [[Lionel]] feels something nagging at him, there is a missed connection somewhere
- We make it back in the early afternoon
